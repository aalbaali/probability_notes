	abstract = {Problem: It is well documented that logging is one of the most dangerous occupations and industries in which to work, and trees fellers are at greatest risk of injury. The objective of this study was to determine whether West Virginia ({WV}) logging companies experienced a reduction in injuries after beginning to use feller-bunchers (tree cutting machines, which replace some of the work done with a chainsaw) during harvesting operations. Methods: {WV} workers compensation claims and employment data from 1995 to 2000 were used to calculate injury rates. Injury trends in the rest of the {WV} logging industry, not using feller-bunchers, were also assessed. Results: For 11 companies, the pre-feller-buncher injury claims rate was 19.4 per 100 workers and the post-feller-buncher rate was 5.2 per 100 workers. This was a significant difference, with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.8 (95\% {CI}: 1.8–4.5) of pre to post claims. Struck by injuries also showed significant decline, with the pre-feller-buncher injury rate being 3.8 (95\% {CI}: 1.8–8.2) times as great as post-feller-buncher rate. During the time of the study, the injury rate rose in the rest of the {WV} logging industry. The average cost of a workers compensation claim in the {WV} logging industry during the time of the study was approximately \$10,400. Impact on industry: As mechanization of logging tasks becomes more widespread, the {WV} logging industry as a whole may see substantial injury declines and a reduction in the total cost of injury claims. Struck by injuries, the most common and potentially fatal of logging injury types, appear to be particularly affected. However, logging operations in areas of very steep terrain where it is not possible to use these machines may need to rely on strategies other than feller-bunchers to reduce injuries.},

	abstract = {This is the first textbook on a generally applicable control strategy for turbulence and other complex nonlinear systems. The approach of the book employs powerful methods of machine learning for optimal nonlinear control laws. This machine learning control ({MLC}) is motivated and detailed in Chapters 1 and 2. In Chapter 3, methods of linear control theory are reviewed. In Chapter 4, {MLC} is shown to reproduce known optimal control laws for linear dynamics ({LQR}, {LQG}). In Chapter 5, {MLC} detects and exploits a strongly nonlinear actuation mechanism of a low-dimensional dynamical system when linear control methods are shown to fail. Experimental control demonstrations from a laminar shear-layer to turbulent boundary-layers are reviewed in Chapter 6, followed by general good practices for experiments in Chapter 7. The book concludes with an outlook on the vast future applications of {MLC} in Chapter 8. Matlab codes are provided for easy reproducibility of the presented results. The book includes interviews with leading researchers in turbulence control (S. Bagheri, B. Batten, M. Glauser, D. Williams) and machine learning (M. Schoenauer) for a broader perspective. All chapters have exercises and supplemental videos will be available through {YouTube}.},

	abstract = {As panoramic photography becomes increasingly popular, there is a greater need for high-quality software to automatically create panoramic images. Existing algorithms either produce a rough "stitch" that cannot deal with common artifacts, or require user input. This paper presents methods for dealing with two artifacts that often occur in practice. Our first contribution is a method for dealing with objects that move between different views of a dynamic scene. If such moving objects are left in, they will appear blurry and "ghosted". Treating such regions as nodes in a graph, we use a vertex cover algorithm to selectively remove all but one instance of each object. Our second contribution is a method for continuously adjusting exposure across multiple images in order to eliminate visible shifts in brightness or hue. We compute exposure corrections on a block-by block basis, then smoothly interpolate the parameters using a spline to get spatially continuous exposure adjustment. Our enhancements, combined with previously published techniques for automatic image stitching, result in a high-quality automated stitcher that exhibits far fewer artifacts than existing software.},

Due to limitations on the available computational power, their levels of abstraction and modeling differ; in particular, vehicle dynamics are often highly simplified at the planning phase, which may lead to inconsistency between the two layers. In this paper, we study the kinematic bicycle model, which is often used for trajectory planning, and compare its results to a 9 degrees of freedom model. Modeling errors and limitations of the kinematic bicycle model are highlighted. Lastly, this paper proposes a simple and efficient consistency criterion in order to validate the use of this model for planning purposes.},

	abstract = {The controllers treated in Volume I were designed for deterministic disturbances, that means for signals which are exactly known a priori and can be described analytically. Real disturbances, however, are mostly stochastic signals which cannot be exactly described nor predicted. The deterministic signals used for the design of control systems are often ‘proxies’ of real signals. These proxies have simple shapes to reduce the design complexity and to allow for easy interpretation of the control system output. The resulting control systems are then optimal only for the chosen proxy signal and the applied criterion. For all other signals the control system is sub-optimal; however, this is not very important in most cases. If the demands on the control performance increase, the controllers must be matched not only to the dynamic behaviour of the processes but also to the disturbances. To this the theory of stochastic signals has much to contribute.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM})consists in the concurrent construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the state of the robot moving within it. The {SLAM} community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of {SLAM}. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for {SLAM}. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active {SLAM} and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of {SLAM}. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need {SLAM}? and Is {SLAM} solved?},

	abstract = {In this paper, we model the robust loop-closure pose-graph {SLAM} problem as a Bayesian network and show that it can be solved with the Classification Expectation-Maximization ({EM}) algorithm. In particular, we express our robust pose-graph {SLAM} as a Bayesian network where the robot poses and constraints are latent and observed variables. An additional set of latent variables is introduced as weights for the loop-constraints. We show that the weights can be chosen as the Cauchy function, which are iteratively computed from the errors between the predicted robot poses and observed loop-closure constraints in the Expectation step, and used to weigh the cost functions from the pose-graph loop-closure constraints in the Maximization step. As a result, outlier loop-closure constraints are assigned low weights and exert less influences in the pose-graph optimization within the {EM} iterations. To prevent the {EM} algorithm from getting stuck at local minima, we perform the {EM} algorithm multiple times where the loop constraints with very low weights are removed after each {EM} process. This is repeated until there are no more changes to the weights. We show proofs of the conceptual similarity between our {EM} algorithm and the M-Estimator. Specifically, we show that the weight function in our {EM} algorithm is equivalent to the robust residual function in the M-Estimator. We verify our proposed algorithm with experimental results from multiple simulated and real-world datasets, and comparisons with other existing works.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05235},
	shorttitle = {{RFM}-{SLAM}},
	abstract = {The {SLAM} problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a {SLAM} framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of {SLAM}. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based {SLAM}. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.},

This paper addresses this challenge through several signiﬁcant improvements. Fully coupled Newton–Krylov methods are presented for the solution of aerostructural systems and for the corresponding adjoint systems. The coupled adjoint method presented can compute gradients with respect to thousands of multidisciplinary design variables accurately and eﬃciently. This is enabled by several improvements in the computation of the multidisciplinary terms in the coupled adjoint. The parallel scalability of the methods is demonstrated for a full aircraft conﬁguration using an Euler computational ﬂuid dynamics model with more than 8 × 106 state variables and a detailed structural ﬁnite element model of the wing with more than 1×106 degrees of freedom. The coupled Newton–Krylov methods are shown to improve the convergence rate of both the aerostructural solution and the coupled adjoint derivative computations. Gradient computations of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables are veriﬁed, and scaling is demonstrated to O(103) variables. The accuracy and scalability of the presented methods make it possible to perform aerostructural optimizations of full aircraft conﬁgurations with respect to hundreds of external shape and structural sizing design variables, leading to optimal aeroelastic tailoring.},

Second, this paper presents to the {MDO} research community a new abstraction for multidisciplinary analysis and design problems as well as new decomposition formulations for these problems. Third, the “individual discipline feasible” ({IDF}) approaches introduced here make use of existing specialized analysis codes, and they introduce significant opportunities for coarse-grained computational parallelism particularly well suited to heterogeneous computing environments.The key distinguishing characteristic of the three fundamental approaches to {MDO} formulation discussed here is the kind of disciplinary feasibility that must be maintained at each optimization iteration. Other formulation issues, such as the sensitivities required, are also considered.

	abstract = {Structural optimization using gradient-based methods is a powerful design technique that is well suited for the design of high-performance structures. However, the ever-increasing complexity of ﬁniteelement models and design formulations results in a bottleneck in the computation of the gradients required for the design optimization. Furthermore, in light of current high-performance computing trends, any methods intended to address this bottleneck must efﬁciently utilize parallel computing resources. Therefore, there is a need for solution and gradient evaluation methods that scale well with the number of design variables, constraints, and processors. We address this need by developing an integrated parallel ﬁnite-element analysis tool for gradient-based design optimization that is designed to use specialized parallel solution methods to solve large-scale high-ﬁdelity structural optimization problems with thousands of design variables, millions of state variables, and hundreds of load cases. We describe the most relevant details of the parallel algorithms used within the tool. We present consistent constraint formulations and aggregation techniques for both material failure and buckling constraints. To demonstrate both the solution and functional accuracy, we compare our results to an exact solution of a pressure-loaded cylinder made with either isotropic or orthotropic material. To demonstrate the parallel solution and gradient evaluation performance, we perform a structural analysis and gradient evaluation for a large transport aircraft wing with over 5.44 million unknowns. The results show near-ideal scalability of the structural solution and gradient computation with the number of design variables, constraints, and processors, which makes this framework well suited for large-scale high-ﬁdelity structural design optimization.},

In the first part, we review numerical optimal control solution methods, focussing exclusively on a discrete time setting. We discuss several algorithmic ”building blocks” that can be combined to a multitude of algorithms. We start by discussing the sequential and simultaneous approaches, the first leading to smaller, the second to more structured optimization problems. The two big families of Newton type optimization methods, Sequential Quadratic Programming ({SQP}) and Interior Point ({IP}) methods, are presented, and we discuss how to exploit the optimal control structure in the solution of the linear-quadratic subproblems, where the two major alternatives are “condensing” and band structure exploiting approaches. The second part of the paper discusses how the algorithms can be adapted to the real-time challenge of {NMPC} and {MHE}. We recall an important sensitivity result from parametric optimization, and show that a tangential solution predictor for online data can easily be generated in Newton type algorithms. We point out one important difference between {SQP} and {IP} methods: while both methods are able to generate the tangential predictor for fixed active sets, the {SQP} predictor even works across active set changes. We then classify many proposed real-time optimization approaches from the literature into the developed categories.},

	abstract = {We present an extension of the adjoint method that allows us to compute the second derivatives of seismic data functionals with respect to Earth model parameters. This work is intended to serve as a technical prelude to the implementation of Newton-like optimization schemes and the development of quantitative resolution analyses in time-domain full seismic waveform inversion. The Hessian operator H applied to a model perturbation δm can be expressed in terms of four different wavefields. The forward field u excited by the regular source, the adjoint field u† excited by the adjoint source located at the receiver position, the scattered forward field δu and the scattered adjoint field δu†. The formalism naturally leads to the notion of Hessian kernels, which are the volumetric densities of Hδm. The Hessian kernels appear as the superposition of (1) a first-order influence zone that represents the approximate Hessian, and (2) second-order influence zones that represent second-order scattering. To aid in the development of physical intuition we provide several examples of Hessian kernels for finite-frequency traveltime measurements on both surface and body waves. As expected, second-order scattering is efficient only when at least one of the model perturbations is located within the first Fresnel zone of the Fréchet kernel. Second-order effects from density heterogeneities are generally negligible in transmission tomography, provided that the Earth model is parameterized in terms of density and seismic wave speeds. With a realistic full waveform inversion for European upper-mantle structure, we demonstrate that significant differences can exist between the approximate Hessian and the full Hessian—despite the near-optimality of the tomographic model. These differences are largest for the off-diagonal elements, meaning that the approximate Hessian can lead to erroneous inferences concerning parameter trade-offs. The full Hessian, in contrast, allows us to correctly account for the effect of non-linearity on model resolution.},

The method combines outer Gauss–Newton nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations, globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of ﬁner grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-{BFGS}/Frankel, regularized by a total variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, ﬁnely discretized by ﬁnite elements in the Lame´ parameter space to provide ﬂexibility and avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessianvector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner, the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the global minimum, and the ability to ﬁt the observational data while reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing sharp interfaces.},

They preserve the rapid local convergence of Newton’s method at a signiﬁcantly reduced cost per step by successively approximating the system Jacobian though low-rank updates. We analyze two variants of the recently proposed adjoint Broyden update, which for the ﬁrst time combines the classical least change property with heredity on afﬁne systems. However, the new update does require, the evaluation of so-called adjoint vectors, namely products of the transposed Jacobian with certain dual direction vectors. The resulting quasi-Newton method is linear contravariant in the sense of Deuﬂhard (Newton methods for nonlinear equations. Springer, Heidelberg, 2006) and it is shown here to be locally and q-superlinearly convergent. Our numerical results on a range of test problems demonstrate that the new method usually outperforms Newton’s and Broyden’s method in terms of runtime and iterations count, respectively.},

This paper overcomes this failure by replacing the initial value problem with the well-conditioned “least squares shadowing ({LSS}) problem”. The {LSS} problem is then linearized in our sensitivity analysis algorithm, which computes a derivative that converges to the derivative of the infinitely long time average. We demonstrate our algorithm in several dynamical systems exhibiting both periodic and chaotic oscillations.},

Unlike a forecast model which describes the evolution of meteorological fields forward in time, the adjoint equations describe the evolution of sensitivity (to initial, boundary and parametric conditions) backward in time. Essentially, by utilizing this sensitivity information, many types of problems can be solved more efficiently than in the past, including variational data assimilation, parameter fitting, optimal instability and sensitivity analysis in general. For this reason, the adjoints of various models and their applications have been appearing more and more frequently in meteorological research. This paper is a bibliography in chronological order of published works in meteorology dealing with adjoints which have appeared prior to this issue of Tellus. Also included are meteorological works regarding variational methods (even without adjoints) and Kalman filtering in data assimilation, plus some references outside meteorology. These additional works are included here because the main thrust for adjoint application within meteorology is currently concentrated in the development of next-generation data assimilation systems.},

From the beginning the ordinary explicit expression for linear in the parameters model is expanded into an implicit expression. Then a generic algorithm in terms of least squares error is developed for the model parameter estimation. It has been proved that a nonlinear rational model can be expressed as an implicit linear in the parameters model, therefore, the developed algorithm can be comfortably revised for estimating the parameters of the rational models. The major advancement of the generic algorithm is its conciseness and efficiency in dealing with the parameter estimation problems associated with nonlinear in the parameters models. Further, the algorithm can be used to deal with those regression terms which are subject to noise. The algorithm is reduced to an ordinary least square algorithm in the case of linear or linear in the parameters models. Three simulated examples plus a realistic case study are used to test and illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the {XIX} century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of {SLAM}, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

The method depends only on the information embedded in the signals of individual events, and therefore does not need any prior position training or calibration. Three possible distributions of the light sources were evaluated: an exact solid-angle-based distribution, an approximate solid-angle distribution and an extended approximate solid-angle-based distribution which includes internal reflection at side and bottom surfaces. The performance of the general model using these three distributions was studied using Monte Carlo simulated data of a 20 × 20 × 10 mm lutetium oxyorthosilicate (Lu2SiO5 or {LSO}) block read out by 2 Hamamatsu S8550 avalanche photo diode arrays. The approximate solid-angle-based model had the best compromise between resolution and simplicity. This model was also evaluated using experimental data by positioning a narrow 1.2 mm full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) beam of 511 {keV} photons at known positions on the 20 × 20 × 10 mm {LSO} block. An average intrinsic resolution in the X-direction of 1.4 mm {FWHM} was obtained for positions covering the complete block. The intrinsic {DOI} resolution was estimated at 2.6 mm {FWHM}.},

Towards this goal, we first reformulate the registration problem using a Truncated Least Squares ({TLS}) cost that makes the estimation insensitive to spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem is still non-convex and combinatorial in nature, we show that (i) {TLS} scale and (component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, (ii) {TLS} rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program ({SDP}) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates. We name the resulting algorithm {TEASER} (Truncated least squares Estimation And {SEmidefinite} Relaxation). While solving large {SDP} relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second certifiable algorithm, named {TEASER}++, that circumvents the need to solve an {SDP} and runs in milliseconds. For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching dataset, and show that (i) both algorithms dominate the state of the art (e.g., {RANSAC}, branch-\&-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than 99\% outliers, (ii) {TEASER}++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust registration algorithm, (iii) {TEASER}++ is so robust it can also solve problems without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences) where it largely outperforms {ICP}. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of {TEASER}++.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in computational modeling is coupling models to solve multidisciplinary problems. Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives ({MAUD}) architecture. {MAUD} formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the {MAUD} architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; {MAUD} automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of {MAUD}: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. {MAUD} is now implemented in the open source framework {OpenMDAO}, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

	abstract = {Establishing global convergence of Newton-{CG} has long been limited to making strong convexity assumptions. Hence, many Newton-type variants have been proposed which aim at extending Newton-{CG} beyond strongly convex problems. However, the analysis of almost all these non-convex methods commonly relies on the Lipschitz continuity assumptions of the gradient and Hessian. Furthermore, the sub-problems of many of these methods are themselves non-trivial optimization problems. Here, we show that two simple modifications of Newton-{CG} result in an algorithm, called Newton-{MR}, which offers a diverse range of algorithmic and theoretical advantages. Newton-{MR} can be applied, beyond the traditional convex settings, to invex problems. Sub-problems of Newton-{MR} are simple ordinary least squares. Furthermore, by introducing a weaker notion of joint regularity of Hessian and gradient, we establish the global convergence of Newton-{MR} even in the absence of the usual smoothness assumptions. We also obtain Newton-{MR}'s local convergence guarantee that generalizes that of Newton-{CG}. Specifically, unlike the local convergence analysis of Newton-{CG}, which relies on the notion of isolated minimum, our analysis amounts to local convergence to the set of minima.},

Agility here refers to the ease and ﬂexibility to assemble, adjust and reconﬁgure {MDAO} computational systems. This is a necessary feature to comply with the complex and iterative nature of the (aircraft) design process. {KADMOS} has been developed on the notion that a formal speciﬁcation of an {MDAO} system is required before proceeding with integration of the executable workﬂow. A thorough formulation of the system becomes essential when such system is built on the many contributions of large, heterogeneous design teams. {KADMOS} can automate the generation of such formulations through a graph-based methodological approach. The graph syntax and manipulation algorithms form the core content of this paper. First, a simple {MDAO} benchmark problem is used to illustrate {KADMOS}’s working principles. Second, a wing aerostructural design case is discussed to demonstrate {KADMOS}’s capabilities to enable collaborative {MDAO} on large problems of industry-representative complexity. Next to its graph-theoretic foundation, {KADMOS} makes use of two data schemas: one containing the parametric representation of the product being designed and a second to store the achieved formulation of the {MDAO} system. The latter enables the interchangeable use of different process integration and design optimization platforms to automatically integrate the generated {MDAO} system formulation as an executable workﬂow. The proposed approach has been estimated to be capable of halving the time typically required to set up and iteratively reconﬁgure a complex {MDAO} system, while allowing discipline experts and system architects to maintain constant oversight and control of the overall system and its components by means of human-readable dynamic visualizations.},

This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering-design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to multidisciplinary design optimization for nonspecialists and a reference detailing all current multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures for specialists.},

While the linear system may be solved using sparse {LDLT} factorization, we observe that other approaches may be used. In particular, we build on the connection between {SQD} linear systems and unconstrained linear least-squares problems to solve the linear system with sparse {QR} factorization. We establish conditions under which a solution of the original, constrained least-squares problem is recovered.

The original {iSAM} algorithm incrementally maintains the square root information matrix by applying matrix factorization updates. We analyze the matrix updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes tree and the conditional densities represented by its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a new method to incrementally change the variable ordering which has a large effect on efficiency. The efficiency and accuracy of the new method is based on fluid relinearization, the concept of selectively relinearizing variables as needed. This allows us to obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any need for periodic batch steps. We analyze the properties of the resulting algorithm in detail, and show on various real and simulated datasets that the {iSAM}2 algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of batch matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, that combines incremental updates with fluid relinearization of a reduced set of variables for efficiency, combined with fast convergence to the exact solution. We also present a novel strategy for incremental variable reordering to retain sparsity.We evaluate our algorithmon standard datasets in both landmark and pose {SLAM} settings.},

Smoothing approaches have been investigated as a viable alternative to extended Kalman filter ({EKF})-based solutions to the problem. In particular, approaches have been looked at that factorize either the associated information matrix or the measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several significant advantages over the {EKF}: they are faster yet exact; they can be used in either batch or incremental mode; are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models; and yield the entire robot trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of {SLAM} problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the {SLAM} problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the {SLAM} problem. Both simulation results and actual {SLAM} experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to {EKF}-based approaches.},

The control scheme is separated into a bank of model-conditional deterministic control gains, and a corresponding bank of known nonlinear functions of the model conditional, causal, mean-square state-vector estimate. The separation here can be viewed as a decomposition of the control into a bank of model conditional optimal non-adaptive linear controls, one for each admissible value of the unknown parameter, and the bank of a-posteriori model probabilities which incorporate the learning nature of the adaptive control. The computational requirements are reduced by a great extent for the special case when the uncertainity is only in the measurement matrix.
Résumé
Un algorithme de contrôle adaptif pour des systèmes linéaires ayant des paramètres constants inconnus et un critère de performance quadratique a été obtenu. Le contrôle est non linéaire dans l'estimation de l'état de l'installation et il est donné comme intégrale chargée des contrôles optimaux conditionels du modèle avec des probabilités à postériori comme charges. Le système de contrôle est divisé en une batterie de gains de contrôle déterministique conditionel du modèle, et en une batterie correspondante de fonctions non linéaires connues de l'estimation de vecteur d'état moyen carré, causal, conditionel du modèle. Cette division peut être considérée ici comme une décomposition du contrôle en une batterie de contrôles linéaires non adaptifs optimaux conditionels du modèle, une pour chaque valeur admissible du paramètre inconnu, et en une batterie de probabilités du modèle à postériori qui incorpore la nature enseignante du contrôle adatif. Les demandes en calcul sont fortement réduites dans le cas spécial où l'incertitude n'existe que dans la matrice de mesure.
Zusammenfassung
Ein Anpassungskontrollalgorithmus für lineare Systeme mit unbekannten, konstanten Parametern und quadratischem Leistungskriterium ist erhalten wordem. Die Kontrolle in der Schätzung des Zustandes der Anlage ist nicht linear und wird als des Gewichtsintegral der modellbedingten optimalen Kontrollen mit den aus der Beobachtung gewonnenen Wahrscheinlichkeiten als Gewichte gegeben. Der Steuerplan wird in einer Bank von modellbedingten deterministischen Steurerverstärkungen und in einer Bank von bekannten nichtlinearen Funktionen der modellbedingten, kausalen, quadratsummendurchschnittlichen Zustandsvektorscha̋tzung separiert. Die Separierung kann hier als eine Zerlegung der Steuerung in eine Bank modellbedingter, optimaler, nicht anpassungsfähiger linearer Steuerungen angesehen werden, eine für jeden zugelassenen Wert der unbekannten Parameter, und in die Bank von aus Beobachtung gewonnenen Wahrscheinlichkeiten, welche die lernende Natur der anpassungsfähigen Steuerung verkörpern. Die rechenbetonten Erfordernisse werden ganz beträchtlich für den Spezialfall reduziert, wenn die Ungewissheit nur in der Bemessungsmatrix liegt.

	abstract = {A key ingredient to achieving intelligent behavior is physical understanding that equips robots with the ability to reason about the effects of their actions in a dynamic environment. Several methods have been proposed to learn dynamics models from data that inform model-based control algorithms. While such learning-based approaches can model locally observed behaviors, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamics and under long time horizons. In this work, we introduce a differentiable physics simulator for rigid body dynamics. Leveraging various techniques for differential equation integration and gradient calculation, we compare different methods for parameter estimation that allow us to infer the simulation parameters that are relevant to estimation and control of physical systems. In the context of trajectory optimization, we introduce a closed-loop model-predictive control algorithm that infers the simulation parameters through experience while achieving cost-minimizing performance.},

We describe Divide and Conquer {SLAM}, which is an {EKF} {SLAM} algorithm in which the computational complexity per step is reduced from O(n 2) to O(n), and the total cost of {SLAM} is reduced from O(n 3) to O(n 2). Unlike many current large-scale {EKF} {SLAM} techniques, this algorithm computes a solution without relying on approximations or simplifications (other than linearizations) to reduce computational complexity. Also, estimates and covariances are available when needed by data association without any further computation. Furthermore, as the method works most of the time in local maps, where angular errors remain small, the effect of linearization errors is limited. The resulting vehicle and map estimates are more precise than those obtained with standard {EKF} {SLAM}. The errors with respect to the true value are smaller, and the computed state covariance is consistent with the real error in the estimation. Both simulated experiments and the Victoria Park dataset are used to provide evidence of the advantages of this algorithm.},

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any {ODE} solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of {ODEs} within larger models.},

Our benchmarks show that on sufficiently small ({\textless}100 parameters) stiff and non-stiff systems of {ODEs}, forward-mode {DSAAD} is more efficient than both reverse-mode {DSAAD} and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to result in better efficiency for larger {ODE} systems such as {PDE} discretizations. In addition to testing efficiency, results on test equations demonstrate the applicability of {DSAAD} to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems where the event timing and effects are dependent on model parameters. Together, these results show that language-level automatic differentiation is an efficient method for calculating local sensitivities of a wide range of differential equation models.},

This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efﬁcient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating {SLAM} is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by ﬁnding the spatial conﬁguration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based {SLAM} problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the {SLAM} problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

	shorttitle = {Julia},
	abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

This paper proposes an analysis framework that allows any kinematic system on a Lie group to be embedded in a natural manner into an equivariant kinematic system. This framework allows us to characterise the properties of, and relationships between, invariant systems, group affine systems, and equivariant systems. We propose a new filter design, the Equivariant Filter ({EqF}), that exploits the equivariance properties of the system embedding and can be applied to any kinematic system on a Lie group.},

An algorithm obtained by combining a least squares estimator with a minimum variance regulator computed from the estimated model is analysed. The main results are two theorems which characterize the closed loop system obtained under the assumption that the parameter estimates converge. The first theorem states that certain covariances of the output and certain cross-covariances of the control variable and the output will vanish under weak assumptions on the system to be controlled. In the second theorem it is assumed that the system to be controlled is a general linear stochastic nth order system. It is shown that if the parameter estimates converge the control law obtained is in fact the minimum variance control law that could be computed if the parameters of the system were known. This is somewhat surprising since the least squares estimate is biased. Some practical implications of the results are discussed. In particular it is shown that the algorithm can be feasibly implemented on a small process computer.},

The measurement function in most common forms of {SLAM} is linear with respect to robot and features’ positions. Therefore, given an estimate for robot orientation, the conditionally optimal estimate for the rest of state variables can be easily obtained by solving a sparse linear-Gaussian estimation problem. We propose an algorithm to exploit this intrinsic property of {SLAM} by stripping the problem down to its nonlinear core, while maintaining its natural sparsity. Our algorithm can be used together with any Newton-based iterative solver and is applicable to 2D/3D pose-graph and feature-based problems. Our results suggest that iteratively solving the nonlinear core of {SLAM} leads to a fast and reliable convergence as compared to the state-of-the-art back-ends.},

We also provide estimates for the basin of attraction of the maximum likelihood solution and results on the uniqueness of such solution. The results confirm observations of related work and explain why common Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) instances are so well-behaved in terms of convergence. Moreover, as a by-product of the derivation, we present different techniques that can enlarge the convergence radius a-priori (i.e., during robot operation) or a-posteriori (i.e., given the data).

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05631},
	abstract = {This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture "concepts" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the "fixed points" of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.},

Aimed at undergraduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, the book's intuitive explanations, lack of advanced prerequisites, and consciously user-friendly prose style will help students to master the subject more readily than was previously possible. The key to this is the book's use of new geometric arguments in place of the standard calculational ones. These geometric arguments are communicated with the aid of hundreds of diagrams of a standard seldom encountered in mathematical works. A new approach to a classical topic, this work will be of interest to students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as to professionals in these fields.},

This paper describes the general structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. Our system has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be speciﬁed in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of {SLAM} and {BA}. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while being general g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of stateof-the-art approaches for the speciﬁc problems.},

Both schedules overcome the essential difficulties of existing schedules in recent literature works where, through introducing a deterministic event-triggering mechanism, the Gaussian property of the innovation process is destroyed which produces a challenging nonlinear filtering problem that cannot be solved unless approximation techniques are adopted. The proposed stochastic event-triggered sensor schedules eliminate such approximations. Under these two schedules, the minimum mean squared error ({MMSE}) estimator and its estimation error covariance matrix at the remote estimator are given in a closed-form. The stability in terms of the expected error covariance and the sample path of the error covariance for both schedules is studied. We also formulate and solve an optimization problem to obtain the minimum communication rate under some estimation quality constraint using the open-loop sensor schedule. A numerical comparison between the closed-loop {MMSE} estimator and a typical approximate {MMSE} estimator with deterministic event-triggered sensor schedule, in a problem setting of target tracking, shows the superiority of the proposed sensor schedule.},

The sensor has computational capability to implement a local Kalman filter. The sensor-to-estimator communications are scheduled intentionally over a finite time horizon to obtain a desirable tradeoff between the state estimation quality and the limited communication resources. Compared with the literature, we adopt a Gaussianity-preserving event-based sensor schedule bypassing the nonlinearity problem met in threshold event-based polices. We derive the closed-form of minimum mean-square error ({MMSE}) estimator and show that, if communication is triggered, the estimator cannot do better than the local Kalman filter, otherwise, the associated error covariance, is simply a sum of the estimation error of the local Kalman filter and the performance loss due to the absence of communication. We further design the scheduler’s parameters by solving a dynamic programming ({DP}) problem. The computational overhead of the {DP} problem is less sensitive to the system dimension compared with that of existing algorithms in the literature.},

No prior information regarding the values of the transition probabilities is provided us (except for a list of forbidden, zero-probability transitions, which is usually obtained as a byproduct of the modeling process itself). The goal is to design an adaptive controller to adequately control the unknown system when its performance is measured by the average cost incurred over a long operating time period. Our main result is the exhibition of a family of adaptive controllers which, when applied to the unknown system, will result in a performance precisely equal to the optimal performance attainable if the system, i.e., the transition probabilities, were known. Hence, the adaptive controllers proposed here are truly optimal, even when operating on an unknown system. The results presented here extend similar results in [1] where we assume to be initially provided with a finite set of possible models, one of which is guaranteed to be the true one. This paper directly addresses those practical situations where a finite set of possible models with such a guarantee is hard to come by.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach.The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a {MATLAB} software package―{PMTK} (probabilistic modeling toolkit)―that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

	abstract = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman ({SCC}), used coordinate-based first-order methods to propagate uncertainty through non-linear functions such as pose composition (head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail). Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality. In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation. This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the {SSC} pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates. An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released. This is a pre-print of a paper submitted to {IEEE} {TRO} in 2019.},

Second, we propose an outlier rejection scheme that can be incorporated in the Weiszfeld algorithm to improve the robustness of \$L\_1\$ rotation averaging. Third, we propose a method for approximating the chordal \$L\_1\$-mean using the Weiszfeld algorithm.

Throughout, emphasis is placed on the use of the dissipative properties of a system for the design of stable feedback control laws. The theory is substantiated by experimental results and by reference to its application in illustrative physical cases (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems and passivity-based and adaptive controllers are covered thoroughly). The second edition is substantially reorganized both to accommodate new material and to enhance its pedagogical properties. Some of the changes introduced are: • Complete proofs of the main theorems and lemmas. • The Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov Lemma for non-minimal realizations, singular systems, and discrete-time systems (linear and nonlinear). • Passivity of nonsmooth systems (differential inclusions, variational inequalities, Lagrangian systems with complementarity conditions). • Sections on optimal control and H-infinity theory. • An enlarged bibliography with more than 550 references, and an augmented index with more than 500 entries. • An improved appendix with introductions to viscosity solutions, Riccati equations and some useful matrix algebra. Praise for the first edition: …an extensive exposition of both the mathematics, physics motivation and control applications of passivity and dissipativity… the richness of a very impressive inventory of illustrating examples stands out as a point of excellence… Automatica …an excellent reference for graduate students, engineers and researchers.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of society and the economy, an increasing number of human activities have gradually destroyed the marine environment. Marine environment monitoring is a vital problem and has increasingly attracted a great deal of research and development attention. During the past decade, various marine environment monitoring systems have been developed. The traditional marine environment monitoring system using an oceanographic research vessel is expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space. Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSNs}) have recently been considered as potentially promising alternatives for monitoring marine environments since they have a number of advantages such as unmanned operation, easy deployment, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art technologies in the field of marine environment monitoring using wireless sensor networks. It first describes application areas, a common architecture of {WSN}-based oceanographic monitoring systems, a general architecture of an oceanographic sensor node, sensing parameters and sensors, and wireless communication technologies. Then, it presents a detailed review of some related projects, systems, techniques, approaches and algorithms. It also discusses challenges and opportunities in the research, development, and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine environment monitoring.},

Routing protocol is one of key technologies in {WSN}. In this paper, the position-based routing protocols are surveyed and classified into four categories: flooding-based, curve-based, grid-based and ant algorithm-based intelligent. To each category, the main contribution of related routing protocols is shown including the relationship among the routing protocols. The different routing algorithms in the same category and the different categories are compared based on popular metrics. Moreover, some open research directions in {WSN} are also discussed.},

Since most cyber attacks happen in erratic ways, it is difficult to describe them systematically. In this paper, instead of identifying a specific cyber attack model, we are focused on analyzing the system's response during cyber attacks. Deception attacks (or false data injection attacks), which are performed by tampering with system components or data, are not of particular concern if they can be easily detected by the system's monitoring system. However, intelligent cyber attackers can avoid being detected by the monitoring system by carefully design cyber attacks. Our main objective is to investigate the performance of such stealthy deception attacks from the system's perspective. We investigate three kinds of stealthy deception attacks according to the attacker's ability to compromise the system. Based on the information about the dynamics of the system and existing hypothesis testing algorithms, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the attacker could perform each kind of attack without being detected. In the end, we illustrate the threat of these cyber attacks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}) navigation example.},

By using the information received from neighboring subsystems and by exploiting the mismatch between a distributed Luenberger observer and a decentralized unknown input observer, we propose a local detection strategy allowing each subsystem to detect anomalies in its neighborhood.

An intelligent attacker can design a sequence of data injection to sensors and actuators that pass the state estimator and statistical fault detector, based on knowledge of the system parameters. To stay undetected, the injected data should increase the state estimation errors while keep the estimation residues small. We employ a coding matrix to change the original sensor outputs to increase the estimation residues under intelligent data injection attacks. This is a low-cost method compared with encryption schemes over all sensor measurements in communication networks. We show the conditions of a feasible coding matrix under the assumption that the attacker does not have knowledge of the exact coding matrix. An algorithm is developed to compute a feasible coding matrix, and, we show that in general, multiple feasible coding matrices exist. To defend against attackers who estimates the coding matrix via sensor and actuator measurements, time-varying coding matrices are designed according to the detection requirements. A heuristic algorithm to decide the time length of updating a coding matrix is then proposed.},

Rotation estimation has a rich history in three scientiﬁc communities: robotics, computer vision, and control theory. We review relevant contributions across these communities, assess their practical use in the {SLAM} domain, and benchmark their performance on representative {SLAM} problems (Fig. 1).

	abstract = {A new version of the extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) is proposed for nonlinear systems possessing symmetries. Instead of using a linear correction term based on a linear output error, it uses a geometrically adapted correction term based on an invariant output error; in the same way the gain matrix is not updated from of a linear state error, but from an invariant state error. The benefit is that the gain and covariance equations converge to constant values on a much bigger set of trajectories than equilibrium points as is the case for the {EKF}, which should result in a better convergence of the estimation. This filter is applied to the practically relevant problem of estimating the velocity and attitude of a moving rigid body, e.g. an aircraft, from {GPS} velocity, inertial and magnetic measurements. In this context it can be seen as an extension of the ¿multiplicative {EKF}¿ often used for quaternion estimation.},

	abstract = {Current solutions to the simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem approach it as the optimization of a graph of geometric constraints. Scalability is achieved by reducing the size of the graph, usually in two phases. First, some selected nodes in the graph are marginalized and then, the dense and nonrelinearizable result is sparsiﬁed. The sparsiﬁed network has a new set of relinearizable factors and is an approximation to the original dense one. Sparsiﬁcation is typically approached as a Kullback–Liebler divergence ({KLD}) minimization between the dense marginalization result and the new set of factors. For a simple topology of the new factors, such as a tree, there is a closed form optimal solution. However, more populated topologies can achieve a much better approximation because more information can be encoded, although in that case iterative optimization is needed to solve the {KLD} minimization. Iterative optimization methods proposed by the state-of-art sparsiﬁcation require parameter tuning that strongly affects their convergence. In this letter, we propose factor descent and noncyclic factor descent, two simple algorithms for {SLAM} sparsiﬁcation that match the state-of-art methods without any parameters to be tuned. The proposed methods are compared against the state of the art with regard to accuracy and {CPU} time, in both synthetic and real world datasets.},

	abstract = {In the context of graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping, node pruning consists in removing a subset of nodes from the graph, while keeping the graph’s information content as close as possible to the original. One often tackles this problem locally by isolating the Markov blanket sub-graph of a node, marginalizing this node and sparsifying the dense result. It means computing an approximation with a new set of factors. For a given approximation topology, the factors’ mean and covariance that best approximate the original distribution can be obtained through minimization of the Kullback-Liebler divergence. For simple topologies such as Chow-Liu trees, there is a closed form for the optimal solution. However, a tree is oftentimes too sparse to explain some graphs. More complex topologies require nonlinear iterative optimization. In the present paper we propose Factor Descent, a new iterative optimization method to sparsify the dense result of node marginalization, which works by iterating factor by factor. We also provide a thorough comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art methods in real world datasets with regards to the obtained solution and convergence rates.},

The presented work is novel with respect to previously published methods in that it contains: (i) a detailed formulation of the Doppler error and its associated uncertainty; (ii) an observability analysis that gives the minimal conditions to infer a 2D twist from radar readings; and (iii) a numerical analysis for optimal vehicle sensor placement.

	shorttitle = {The Power of Convex Relaxation},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of recovering an unknown matrix from a small fraction of its entries. This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible; but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful. This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n).},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals and then play them back to the system, can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time invariant ({LTI}) systems. Though {LTI} models are sufficient for some applications, other {CPS}, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This paper develops a linear time-varying ({LTV}) extension to previous Dynamic Watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using a {LTV} vehicle model.},

To better describe the characteristics of power forecast error, a probability density function should be established. Compared with the Kernel density estimation method, this paper adopts the Gaussian mixture model ({GMM}), which is flexible enough to capture different error distribution characteristics, such as bias, heavy tail, multi-peak, and so on. In addition, for {GMM} parameter estimation, when dealing with a large number of multi-dimensional data sets or unbalanced overlapping mixtures, the expectation maximization ({EM}) algorithm shows a slower convergence speed and requires a high number of iterations. In this paper, a new L-{BFGS} optimization method, based on the Riemannian manifold, is used for {GMM} parameter estimation. Based on actual wind power forecast error data, the suitability of the model and the new optimization algorithm was verified in large, multi-dimensional data sets. The new optimization algorithm has fewer iterations than the {EM} algorithm, with an improved convergence speed.},

Separability is an overlooked structure of {SLAM} that distinguishes it from a generic nonlinear least-squares problem. The standard relative-pose and relative-position measurement models in {SLAM} are affine with respect to robot and features' positions. Therefore, given an estimate for robot orientation, the conditionally optimal estimate for the rest of the state variables can be easily computed by solving a sparse linear least-squares problem. We propose an algorithm to exploit this intrinsic property of {SLAM} by stripping the problem down to its nonlinear core, while maintaining its natural sparsity. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with any Newton-based solver and is applicable to 2-D/3-D pose-graph and feature-based {SLAM}. Our results suggest that iteratively solving the nonlinear core of {SLAM} leads to a fast and reliable convergence as compared to the state-of-the-art sparse back-ends.},

In this paper we present a formal analysis of the impact of graph structure on the reliability of the maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees in the graph is closely related to the D-optimality criterion in experimental design. We also reveal that in a special class of linear-Gaussian estimation problems over graphs, the algebraic connectivity is related to the E-optimality design criterion. Furthermore, we explain how the average node degree of the graph is related to the ratio between the minimum of negative log-likelihood achievable and its value at the ground truth. These novel insights give us a deeper understanding of the {SLAM} problem. Finally we discuss two important applications of our analysis in active measurement selection and graph pruning.

This paper studies the relation between the graphical representation of such problems and estimationtheoretic concepts such as the Cramér-Rao lower bound ({CRLB}) and D-optimality. We prove that the weighted number of spanning trees, as a graph connectivity metric, is closely related to the determinant of {CRLB}.

	shorttitle = {{SE}-Sync},
	abstract = {Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a set of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact {MLE} so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, {SE}-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph {SLAM} datasets shows that {SE}-Sync is able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes ({GPs}), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the {GP} model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration that maximizes mutual information is {NP}-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the {GP}, yielding signiﬁcant speedups. We also extend our approach to ﬁnd placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

	abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the {NP}-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes ({GPs})both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of unsensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, {pSPIEL}, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our {pSPIEL} approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08021},
	abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, a variety of randomized algorithms have been proposed for computing approximate least-squares ({LS}) solutions in large-scale settings. A longstanding practical issue is that, for any given input, the user rarely knows the actual error of an approximate solution (relative to the exact solution). Likewise, it is difficult for the user to know precisely how much computation is needed to achieve the desired error tolerance. Consequently, the user often appeals to worst-case error bounds that tend to offer only qualitative guidance. As a more practical alternative, we propose a bootstrap method to compute a posteriori error estimates for randomized {LS} algorithms. These estimates permit the user to numerically assess the error of a given solution, and to predict how much work is needed to improve a "preliminary" solution. In addition, we provide theoretical consistency results for the method, which are the first such results in this context (to the best of our knowledge). From a practical standpoint, the method also has considerable flexibility, insofar as it can be applied to several popular sketching algorithms, as well as a variety of error metrics. Moreover, the extra step of error estimation does not add much cost to an underlying sketching algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with empirical results.},

In a typical setting, one lets n be the number of constraints and d be the number of variables, with \$\$\{n {\textbackslash}gg d\}\$\$. Then, existing exact methods find a solution vector in O(nd2) time. We present two randomized algorithms that provide accurate relative-error approximations to the optimal value and the solution vector of a least squares approximation problem more rapidly than existing exact algorithms. Both of our algorithms preprocess the data with the Randomized Hadamard transform. One then uniformly randomly samples constraints and solves the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error approximations, and, if n is sufficiently larger than d, the approximate solution can be computed in O(nd ln d) time.},

State-of-the-art approaches have been demonstrated to be very efficient in medium- and large-sized scenarios; however, their convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate heavily relies on the quality of the initial guess. We show that, in planar scenarios, pose graph optimization has a very peculiar structure. The problem of estimating robot orientations from relative orientation measurements is a quadratic optimization problem (after computing suitable regularization terms); moreover, given robot orientations, the overall optimization problem becomes quadratic. We exploit these observations to design an approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate, which does not require the availability of an initial guess. The approximation, named {LAGO} (Linear Approximation for pose Graph Optimization), can be used as a stand-alone tool or can bootstrap state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. We provide analytical results on existence and sub-optimality of {LAGO}, and we discuss the factors influencing its quality. Experimental results demonstrate that {LAGO} is accurate in common {SLAM} problems. Moreover, it is remarkably faster than state-of-the-art techniques, and is able to solve very large-scale problems in a few seconds.},

The objective is to elucidate the connection between simple tree-based message passing rules with the aforementioned state estimation approaches, and their frequently overlooked relation to direct marginalization on the Bayes tree. We characterize the inherent marginalization operation as part of the fundamental Chapman-Kolmogorov transit integrals which uniﬁes many state-of-the-art approaches. The belief propagation model is then used to deﬁne ﬁve major tree inference strategies, with regard to computation recycling and resource constrained operation. A series of illustrative examples and results show the versatility of the method.},

	abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for online, real-time orientation estimation. Our algorithm integrates gyroscope data and corrects the resulting orientation estimate for integration drift using accelerometer and magnetometer data. This correction is computed, at each time instance, using a single gradient descent step with fixed step length. This fixed step length results in robustness against model errors, e.g. caused by large accelerations or by short-term magnetic field disturbances, which we numerically illustrate using Monte Carlo simulations. Our algorithm estimates a three-dimensional update to the orientation rather than the entire orientation itself. This reduces the computational complexity by approximately 1/3 with respect to the state of the art. It also improves the quality of the resulting estimates, specifically when the orientation corrections are large. We illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm using experimental data.},

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions.},

In addition to learning the governing equations of deterministic systems, which then reduces to {SINDy} (sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics), it is possible to identify the drift and diffusion terms of stochastic differential equations from data. Moreover, we apply {gEDMD} to derive coarse-grained models of high-dimensional systems, and also to determine efficient model predictive control strategies.

	abstract = {Automatic differentiation ({AD}) is a useful tool for computing Jacobians of functions needed in estimation and control algorithms. However, for many interesting problems in robotics, state variables live on a differentiable manifold. The most common example are robot orientations that are elements of the Lie group {SO}(3). This causes problems for {AD} algorithms that only consider differentiation at the scalar level. Jacobians produced by scalar {AD} are correct, but scalar-focused methods are unable to apply simplifications based on the structure of the specific manifold. In this paper we extend the theory of {AD} to encompass handling of differentiable manifolds and provide a C++ library that exploits strong typing and expression templates for fast, easy-to-use Jacobian evaluation. This method has a number of benefits over scalar {AD}. First, it allows the exploitation of algebraic simplifications that make Jacobian evaluations more efficient than their scalar counterparts. Second, strong typing reduces the likelihood of programming errors arising from misinterpretation that are possible when using simple arrays of scalars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the structure of differentiable manifolds directly in {AD}.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of continuous time gradient-based optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements. Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.},

Exploiting this symmetry leads to a simple fully non-linear gradient based observer with almost global asymptotic and local exponential stability properties. Simulation experiments verify the observer design, and demonstrate that the proposed observer achieves similar accuracy to the widely used Extended Kalman Filter with significant gains in processing time (linear verses quadratic bounds with respect to number of landmarks) and qualitative improvements in robustness.},

	abstract = {Current state of the art solutions of the {SLAM} problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in pose graphs the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e.g. obtained from odometry) and information on loop closures. The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive loop closures will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely increases the overall robustness of the {SLAM} system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers. We demonstrate the approach and present results both on large scale synthetic and real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {Exploration of unknown environments is embedded and essential in many robotics applications. Traditional algorithms, that decide where to explore by computing the expected information gain of an incomplete map from future sensor measurements, are limited to very powerful computational platforms. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for computing this expected information gain efﬁciently, as principally derived via mutual information. The key idea behind the proposed approach is a continuous occupancy map framework and the recursive structure it reveals. This structure makes it possible to compute the expected information gain of sensor measurements across an entire map much faster than computing each measurements’ expected gain independently. Speciﬁcally, for an occupancy map composed of {\textbar}M {\textbar} cells and a range sensor that emits {\textbar}Θ{\textbar} measurement beams, the algorithm (titled {FCMI}) computes the information gain corresponding to measurements made at each cell in O({\textbar}Θ{\textbar}{\textbar}M {\textbar}) steps. To the best of our knowledge, this complexity bound is better than all existing methods for computing information gain. In our experiments, we observe that this novel, continuous approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art {FSMI} algorithm.},

The research community deeply investigated this topic in the last years, and this resulted in the development of several open-source solvers to approach constantly increasing classes of problems. In this work, we propose a unified methodology to design and develop efficient Least-Squares Optimization algorithms, focusing on the structures and patterns of each specific domain. Furthermore, we present a novel open-source optimization system, that addresses transparently problems with a different structure and designed to be easy to extend. The system is written in modern C++ and can run efficiently on embedded systems. Source code: https://srrg.gitlab.io/srrg2-solver.html. We validated our approach by conducting comparative experiments on several problems using standard datasets. The results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performances in all tested scenarios.},

	abstract = {Many important geometric estimation problems naturally take the form of synchronization over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of unknown group elements x1,?,xn?{SE}(d) given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms xi?1xj. Examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. This inference problem is typically formulated as a non-convex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation ({MLE}) whose minimizer provides an exact maximum-likelihood estimate so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem defined on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, {SE}-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph {SLAM} datasets shows that {SE}-Sync is capable of recovering certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so significantly faster than the Gauss?Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.},

Consequently the approach to the limit of the discrete-time filter to obtain its continuous-time equivalent no longer depends on Kalman's non-rigorous argument for dividing the covariance of a white noise sequence by the sampling interval Δt. Such an exact equivalence is essential for comparing the accuray of discrete-time computations with results obtained by numerically integrating the continuous-time filter equations.

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of continuous-time nonlinear filtering of stochastic processes evolving on connected Riemannian manifolds without boundary. The main contribution of this paper is to derive the feedback particle filter ({FPF}) algorithm for this problem. In its general form, the {FPF} is shown to provide an intrinsic description of the filter that automatically satisfies the geometric constraints of the manifold. The particle dynamics are encapsulated in a Stratonovich stochastic differential equation that retains the feedback structure of the original (Euclidean) {FPF}. The implementation of the filter requires a solution of a Poisson equation on the manifold, and a numerical algorithm is described for this purpose. For the special case when the manifold is a matrix Lie group, explicit formulae for the filter are derived, using the matrix coordinates. Filters for two example problems are presented: the attitude estimation problem on {SO}(3) and the robot localization problem in {SE}(3). Comparisons are also provided between the {FPF} and popular algorithms for attitude estimation, namely the multiplicative extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), the invariant {EKF}, the unscented quaternion estimator, the invariant ensemble Kalman filter, and the bootstrap particle filter. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate these comparisons.},

A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation.

This book aims at providing a general overview of the dependability of computing systems: impairments and protective means.

Riemannian optimization has been a topic of much interest over the past few years due to many applications including computer vision, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra. The substantial background required to successfully design and apply Riemannian optimization algorithms is a signiﬁcant impediment for many potential users.

Unlike prior packages, {ROPTLIB} simultaneously achieves the following goals: i) it has userfriendly interfaces in Matlab, Julia and C++; ii) users do not need to implement manifoldand algorithm-related objects; iii) it provides eﬃcient computational time due to its C++ core; iv) it implements state-of-the-art generic Riemannian optimization algorithms, including {quasiNewton} algorithms; and v) it is based on object-oriented programming, allowing users to rapidly add new algorithms and manifolds.},

	title = {{FastSLAM}: A Factored Solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem},
	abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman ﬁlter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents {FastSLAM}, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the {FastSLAM} algorithm on both simulated and realworld data.},

Unlike line search type methods where a line search is carried out in each iteration, trust region methods compute a trial step by solving a trust region subproblem where a model function is minimized within a trust region. Due to the trust region constraint, nonconvex models can be used in trust region subproblems, and trust region algorithms can be applied to nonconvex and ill-conditioned problems. Normally it is easier to establish the global convergence of a trust region algorithm than that of its line search counterpart. In the paper, we review recent results on trust region methods for unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares, nonsmooth optimization and optimization without derivatives. Results on trust region subproblems and regularization methods are also discussed.},

	abstract = {A wide range of system models in modern robotics and avionics applications admit natural symmetries. Such systems are termed equivariant and the structure provided by the symmetry is a powerful tool in the design of observers. Significant progress has been made in the last ten years in the design of filters and observers for attitude and pose estimation, tracking of homographies, and velocity aided attitude estimation, by exploiting their inherent Lie-group state-space structure. However, little work has been done for systems on homogeneous spaces, that is systems on manifolds on which a Lie-group acts rather than systems on the Lie-group itself. Recent research in robotic vision has discovered symmetries and equivariant structure on homogeneous spaces for a host of problems including the key problems of visual odometry and visual simultaneous localisation and mapping. These discoveries motivate a deeper look at the structure of equivariant systems on homogeneous spaces. This paper provides a comprehensive development of the foundation theory required to undertake observer and filter design for such systems.},

	abstract = {We propose a general and practical framework to design certifiable algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of a large amount of outliers. We investigate the use of a truncated least squares ({TLS}) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our first contribution is to show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- {TLS} estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex {TLS} problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program ({SDP}) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares ({SOS}) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as {RANSAC} or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility {SDP}. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current {SDP} solvers.},

	abstract = {A new shape-from-focus method is described which is based on a new concept, named focused image surface ({FIS}). {FIS} of an object is defined as the surface formed by the set of points at which the object points are focused by a camera lens. According to paraxial-geometric optics, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the shape of an object and the shape of its {FIS}. Therefore, the problem of shape recovery can be posed as the problem of determining the shape of the {FIS}. From the shape of {FIS} the shape of the object is easily obtained. In this paper the shape of the {FIS} is determined by searching for a shape which maximizes a focus measure. In contrast to previous literature where the focus measure is computed over the planar image detector of the camera, here the focus measure is computed over the {FIS}. This results in more accurate shape recovery than the traditional methods. Also, using {FIS}, a more accurate focused image can be reconstructed from a sequence of images than is possible with traditional methods. The new method has been implemented on an actual camera system, and the results of shape recovery and focused image reconstruction are presented.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

To achieve this, we first present a novel approach to estimate the amount of spatially varying defocus blur at edge locations. We re-blur the input image and show that the gradient magnitude ratio between the input and re-blurred images depends only on the amount of defocus blur. Thus, the blur amount can be obtained from the ratio. A layered depth map is then extracted by propagating the blur amount at edge locations to the entire image. Experimental results on synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing a reliable estimate of the depth of a scene.},

Existing computational methods to capture {RGB} and depth either purposefully modify the optics (coded aperture, light-ﬁeld imaging), or employ active {RGB}-D cameras. Since these methods are less practical for users with normal cameras, we present an algorithm to capture all-in-focus {RGB}-D video of dynamic scenes with an unmodiﬁed commodity video camera. Our algorithm turns the often unwanted defocus blur into a valuable signal. The input to our method is a video in which the focus plane is continuously moving back and forth during capture, and thus defocus blur is provoked and strongly visible. This can be achieved by manually turning the focus ring of the lens during recording. The core algorithmic ingredient is a new video-based depth-from-defocus algorithm that computes space-time-coherent depth maps, deblurred all-in-focus video, and the focus distance for each frame. We extensively evaluate our approach, and show that it enables compelling video post-processing effects, such as different types of refocusing.},

Existing depth estimation methods commonly use an active light source to detect the depth of an object. However, sunlight interferes with their depth measurements and decreases their accuracy outdoors. The proposed method does not need any active light source because depth information is obtained in the image domain, not in the object domain. The depth of field imaging by a retroreflector indicates the depth position of the object image, immediately. We believe that the proposed method can be applied to depth measurement systems such as {LIDAR} and time of flight cameras. An experiment is performed, whose results are compared with theoretical calculations, which confirms the feasibility of the proposed method.},

We present a system to computationally synthesize shallow depth-of-field images with a single mobile camera and a single button press. If the image is of a person, we use a person segmentation network to separate the person and their accessories from the background. If available, we also use dense dual-pixel auto-focus hardware, effectively a 2-sample light field with an approximately 1 millimeter baseline, to compute a dense depth map. These two signals are combined and used to render a defocused image. Our system can process a 5.4 megapixel image in 4 seconds on a mobile phone, is fully automatic, and is robust enough to be used by non-experts. The modular nature of our system allows it to degrade naturally in the absence of a dual-pixel sensor or a human subject.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have enabled rapid progress in monocular depth estimation, but their quality is limited by the ill-posed nature of the problem and the scarcity of high quality datasets. We estimate depth from a single camera by leveraging the dual-pixel auto-focus hardware that is increasingly common on modern camera sensors. Classic stereo algorithms and prior learning-based depth estimation techniques under-perform when applied on this dual-pixel data, the former due to too-strong assumptions about {RGB} image matching, and the latter due to not leveraging the understanding of optics of dual-pixel image formation. To allow learning based methods to work well on dual-pixel imagery, we identify an inherent ambiguity in the depth estimated from dual-pixel cues, and develop an approach to estimate depth up to this ambiguity. Using our approach, existing monocular depth estimation techniques can be effectively applied to dual-pixel data, and much smaller models can be constructed that still infer high quality depth. To demonstrate this, we capture a large dataset of in-the-wild 5-viewpoint {RGB} images paired with corresponding dual-pixel data, and show how view supervision with this data can be used to learn depth up to the unknown ambiguities. On our new task, our model is 30\% more accurate than any prior work on learning-based monocular or stereoscopic depth estimation.},

To enable learning algorithms to use aperture effects as supervision, we introduce two differentiable aperture rendering functions that use the input image and predicted depths to simulate the depth-of-field effects caused by real camera apertures.

However, since then, the vision community has focused heavily on shading cues for reconstruction, and moved towards data-driven approaches for recognition. In this paper, we reconsider these perhaps overlooked "boundary" cues (such as self occlusions and folds in a surface), as well as many other established constraints for shape reconstruction. In a variety of user studies and quantitative tasks, we evaluate how well these cues inform shape reconstruction (relative to each other) in terms of both shape quality and shape recognition. Our findings suggest many new directions for future research in shape reconstruction, such as automatic boundary cue detection and relaxing assumptions in shape from shading (e.g. orthographic projection, Lambertian surfaces).},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of localizing a manned, semiautonomous, or autonomous vehicle in the environment using information coming from the vehicle's sensors, a problem known as navigation or simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) depending on the context. To infer knowledge from sensors' measurements, while drawing on a priori knowledge about the vehicle's dynamics, modern approaches solve an optimization problem to compute the most likely trajectory given all past observations, an approach known as smoothing. Improving smoothing solvers is an active field of research in the {SLAM} community. Most work is focused on reducing computation load by inverting the involved linear system while preserving its sparsity. This article raises an issue that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed yet: standard smoothing solvers require explicitly using the inverse of sensor noise covariance matrices. This means the parameters that reflect the noise magnitude must be sufficiently large for the smoother to properly function. When matrices are close to singular, which is the case when using high-precision modern inertial measurement units ({IMUs}), numerical issues necessarily arise, especially with 32-bit implementation demanded by most industrial aerospace applications. We discuss these issues and propose a solution that builds upon the Kalman filter to improve smoothing algorithms. We then leverage the results to devise a localization algorithm based on the fusion of {IMU} and vision sensors. Successful real experiments using an actual car equipped with a tactical grade high-performance {IMU} and a {LiDAR} illustrate the relevance of the approach to the field of autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract = {The most common way to deal with the uncertainty present in noisy sensorial perception and action is to model the problem with a probabilistic framework. Maximum likelihood estimation is a well-known estimation method used in many robotic and computer vision applications. Under Gaussian assumption, the maximum likelihood estimation converts to a nonlinear least squares problem. Efficient solutions to nonlinear least squares exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until convergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of the mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too expensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next best view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general performed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step and its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may become highly computationally demanding.This paper introduces a general framework for incremental maximum likelihood estimation called {SLAM}++, which fully benefits from the incremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient estimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that, we propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state representation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures to integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state representation. {SLAM}++ differs from existing implementations by performing all the matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation and arithmetic operations used in nonlinear least squares. Even though this paper tests {SLAM}++ efficiency on {SLAM} problems, its applicability remains general.},

	abstract = {Many estimation problems in robotics rely on efficiently solving nonlinear least squares ({NLS}). For example, it is well known that the simultaneous localisation and mapping ({SLAM}) problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation ({MLE}) and solved using {NLS}, yielding a mean state vector. However, for many applications recovering only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, active decisions, next best view, are only few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. The problem is not simple since, in general, the covariance is obtained by inverting the system matrix and the result is dense. The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm for fast incremental covariance update, complemented by a highly efficient implementation of the covariance recovery. This combination yields to two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time, compared to the other state of the art solutions. The proposed algorithm is applicable to any {NLS} solver implementation, and does not depend on incremental strategies described in our previous papers, which are not a subject of this paper.},

	abstract = {Data association is one of the core problems of simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}), and it requires knowledge about the uncertainties of the estimation problem in the form of marginal covariances. However, it is often diﬃcult to access these quantities without calculating the full and dense covariance matrix, which is prohibitively expensive. We present a dynamic programming algorithm for eﬃcient recovery of the marginal covariances needed for data association. As input we use a square root information matrix as maintained by our incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) algorithm. The contributions beyond our previous work are an improved algorithm for recovering the marginal covariances and a more thorough treatment of data association now including the joint compatibility branch and bound ({JCBB}) algorithm. We further show how to make information theoretic decisions about measurements before actually taking the measurement, therefore allowing a reduction in estimation complexity by omitting uninformative measurements. We evaluate our work on simulated and real-world data.},

	abstract = {We are concerned with improving the range resolution of stereo vision for entry, descent, and landing ({EDL}) missions to Mars and other planetary bodies. The goal is to create accurate and precise three-dimensional planetary surface-structure estimates by filtering sequences of stereo images taken from an autonomous landing vehicle. We describe a sliding window filter ({SWF}) approach based on delayed state marginalization. The {SWF} can run in constant time, yet still achieve experimental results close to those of the bundle adjustment solution. This technique can scale from the offline batch least-squares solution to fast online incremental solutions. For instance, if the window encompasses all time, the solution is equivalent to full bundle adjustment; if only one time step is maintained, the solution matches the extended Kalman filter; if poses and landmarks are slowly marginalized out over time such that the state vector ceases to grow, then the filter becomes constant time, like visual odometry. Within the constant time regime, the sliding window approach demonstrates convergence properties that are close to those of the full batch solution and strictly superior to visual odometry. Experiments with real data show that ground structure estimates follow the expected convergence pattern that is predicted by theory. These experiments indicate the effectiveness of filtering long-range stereo for {EDL}. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed enormous progress in {AI}-related fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing field, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several survey papers on particular sub-problems have appeared, no comprehensive survey on problems, datasets, and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles has been published. This book attempts to narrow this gap by providing a survey on the state-of-the-art datasets and techniques. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state of the art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding, and end-to-end learning for autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we analyze the performance of the state of the art on several challenging benchmarking datasets, including {KITTI}, {MOT}, and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we also provide a website that allows navigating topics as well as methods and provides additional information.},

	abstract = {A useful representation of signal data, besides being a complete and stable transformation of the information, should make explicit important features in the data. In computer vision, the oneparameter family of images obtained from the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian-filtered version of the image, parameterized by the width of the Gaussian, has proven to be a useful data structure for the extraction of feature data. In particular,the zero crossingsof these so-called scalespace data are associated with edges, and were proposed by Marr and others as the basis of a representation of the image data. The question arises as to whether the representationis complete and stable. We survey some of the results and studies related to these questions, and survey several papers that attempt reconstructions based on this or related representations. We then formulate a new method for the reconstructionfrom zero crossings in scale space, based on minimizing equation error, and present results showing that the reconstruction is possible, but can be unstable. We further show that the method applies when gradient data along the zero crossings are included in the representation, and demonstrate empirically that the reconstruction is then stable.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood ({ML}) and restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) are nowadays very popular in geophysics, geodesy and many other fields. There is also a growing number of investigations into how to calculate covariance parameters by {ML}/{REML} accurately and fast, and assure the convergence of the iteration steps in derivative-based approaches. The latter condition is not satisfied in many solutions, as it requires composed procedures or takes an unacceptable amount of time. The article implements efficient Fisher scoring ({FS}) to covariance parameter estimation in least-squares collocation ({LSC}). {FS} is optimized through Levenberg–Marquardt ({LM}) optimization, which provides stability in convergence when estimating two covariance parameters necessary for {LSC}. The motivation for this work was a very large number of non-optimized {FS} in the literature, as well as a deficiency of its scientific and engineering applications. The example work adds some usefulness to maximum likelihood estimation ({ML}) and {FS} and shows a new application—an alternative approach to {LSC}—a parametrization with no empirical covariance estimation. The results of {LM} damping applied to {FS} ({FSLM}) require some additional research related with optimal {LM} parameter. However, the method appears to be a milestone in relation to non-optimized {FS}, in terms of convergence. The {FS} with {LM} provides a reliable convergence, whose speed can be adjusted by manipulating the {LM} parameter.},

	shorttitle = {Graduated Non-Convexity for Robust Spatial Perception},
	abstract = {Semidefinite Programming ({SDP}) and Sums-of-Squares ({SOS}) relaxations have led to certifiably optimal non-minimal solvers for several robotics and computer vision problems. However, most non-minimal solvers rely on least-squares formulations, and, as a result, are brittle against outliers. While a standard approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions, the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of existing non-minimal solvers. In this paper, we enable the simultaneous use of non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem where a non-minimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end, we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and show that graduated non-convexity ({GNC}) can be used in conjunction with non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial guess. Although {GNC}'s global optimality cannot be guaranteed, we demonstrate the empirical robustness of the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80\% of outliers, outperform {RANSAC}, are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized global solvers. We also propose the first certifiably optimal non-minimal solver for shape alignment using {SOS} relaxation.},

However, their extension to dynamic processes has been elusive so far since standard machine learning tools give rise unscalable algorithms. In this work we propose a systematic and explicit procedure to address this problem by pairing {GP} regression with Kalman Filtering. In particular, under the speciﬁc timespace separability assumption of the kernel which models process and periodic sampling on a (possibly non-uniform) space-grid, we show how to build a ﬁnite dimensional discretetime state-space exact representation for the modeled process. The major ﬁnding is that the state at instant k of the associated Kalman Filter represents a sufﬁcient statistic to compute the minimum variance prediction of the process at instant k over any arbitrary ﬁnite subset of the space. The proposed strategy is then compared with the standard non-parametric estimation and truncated non-parametric estimation strategies both in terms of estimation performance and computation complexity.},

Deep neural networks have provided a new way to perform these tasks, and the choice of rotation representation is an important part of network design. In this work, we present a novel symmetric matrix representation of the 3D rotation group, {SO}(3), with two important properties that make it particularly suitable for learned models: (1) it satisﬁes a smoothness property that improves convergence and generalization when regressing large rotation targets, and (2) it encodes a symmetric Bingham belief over the space of unit quaternions, permitting the training of uncertainty-aware models. We empirically validate the beneﬁts of our formulation by training deep neural rotation regressors on two data modalities. First, we use synthetic point-cloud data to show that our representation leads to superior predictive accuracy over existing representations for arbitrary rotation targets. Second, we use image data collected onboard ground and aerial vehicles to demonstrate that our representation is amenable to an effective out-of-distribution ({OOD}) rejection technique that signiﬁcantly improves the robustness of rotation estimates to unseen environmental effects and corrupted input images, without requiring the use of an explicit likelihood loss, stochastic sampling, or an auxiliary classiﬁer. This capability is key for safety-critical applications where detecting novel inputs can prevent catastrophic failure of learned models.},

	abstract = {In neural networks, it is often desirable to work with various representations of the same space. For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a deﬁnition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difﬁcult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n dimensional rotation group {SO}(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We ﬁnally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.},

Application domains include robotics, wearable computing, augmented reality, and automotive. The term {VO} was coined in 2004 by Nister in his landmark paper. The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, {VO} operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For {VO} to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.},

Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for {VO} to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, {VO} has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. {VO} offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.},

	abstract = {The Wahba problem, also known as rotation search, seeks to find the best rotation to align two sets of vector observations given putative correspondences, and is a fundamental routine in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work proposes the first polynomial-time certifiably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our first contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares ({TLS}) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the {TLS} cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program ({QCQP}). Since the resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally, our third contribution is to develop a convex Semidefinite Programming ({SDP}) relaxation. We show that while a naive relaxation performs poorly in general, our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm, named {QUASAR} ({QUAternion}-based Semidefinite {relAxation} for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing that the algorithm outperforms {RANSAC}, robust local optimization techniques, global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. {QUASAR} is able to compute certifiably optimal solutions (i.e. the relaxation is exact) even in the case when 95\% of the correspondences are outliers.},

	abstract = {Kalman filters are routinely used for many data fusion applications including navigation, tracking, and simultaneous localization and mapping problems. However, significant time and effort is frequently required to tune various Kalman filter model parameters, e.g. process noise covariance, pre-whitening filter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new "black box" Bayesian optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman filters. In this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective functions: normalized estimation error squared ({NEES}) when ground truth state models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared ({NIS}) when only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for the {NEES}/{NIS} costs, Bayesian optimization can efficiently identify multiple local minima and provide uncertainty quantification on its results.},

Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The {EM} (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood ({ML}) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The {EM} algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08333},
	abstract = {We present a Gaussian Variational Inference ({GVI}) technique that can be applied to large-scale nonlinear batch state estimation problems. The main contribution is to show how to fit both the mean and (inverse) covariance of a Gaussian to the posterior efficiently, by exploiting factorization of the joint likelihood of the state and data, as is common in practical problems. This is different than Maximum A Posteriori ({MAP}) estimation, which seeks the point estimate for the state that maximizes the posterior (i.e., the mode). The proposed Exactly Sparse Gaussian Variational Inference ({ESGVI}) technique stores the inverse covariance matrix, which is typically very sparse (e.g., block-tridiagonal for classic state estimation). We show that the only blocks of the (dense) covariance matrix that are required during the calculations correspond to the non-zero blocks of the inverse covariance matrix, and further show how to calculate these blocks efficiently in the general {GVI} problem. {ESGVI} operates iteratively, and while we can use analytical derivatives at each iteration, Gaussian cubature can be substituted, thereby producing an efficient derivative-free batch formulation. {ESGVI} simplifies to precisely the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ({RTS}) smoother in the batch linear estimation case, but goes beyond the 'extended' {RTS} smoother in the nonlinear case since it finds the best-fit Gaussian (mean and covariance), not the {MAP} point estimate. We demonstrate the technique on controlled simulation problems and a batch nonlinear Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) problem with an experimental dataset.},

	abstract = {High dimensional error covariance matrices and their inverses are used to weight the contribution of observation and background information in data assimilation procedures. As observation error covariance matrices are often obtained by sampling methods, estimates are often degenerate or ill-conditioned, making it impossible to invert an observation error covariance matrix without the use of techniques to reduce its condition number. In this paper, we present new theory for two existing methods that can be used to ‘recondition’ any covariance matrix: ridge regression and the minimum eigenvalue method. We compare these methods with multiplicative variance inflation, which cannot alter the condition number of a matrix, but is often used to account for neglected correlation information. We investigate the impact of reconditioning on variances and correlations of a general covariance matrix in both a theoretical and practical setting. Improved theoretical understanding provides guidance to users regarding method selection, and choice of target condition number. The new theory shows that, for the same target condition number, both methods increase variances compared to the original matrix, with larger increases for ridge regression than the minimum eigenvalue method. We prove that the ridge regression method strictly decreases the absolute value of off-diagonal correlations. Theoretical comparison of the impact of reconditioning and multiplicative variance inflation on the data assimilation objective function shows that variance inflation alters information across all scales uniformly, whereas reconditioning has a larger effect on scales corresponding to smaller eigenvalues. We then consider two examples: a general correlation function, and an observation error covariance matrix arising from interchannel correlations. The minimum eigenvalue method results in smaller overall changes to the correlation matrix than ridge regression but can increase off-diagonal correlations. Data assimilation experiments reveal that reconditioning corrects spurious noise in the analysis but underestimates the true signal compared to multiplicative variance inflation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents {ORB}-{SLAM}3, the first system able to perform visual, visual-inertial and multi-map {SLAM} with monocular, stereo and {RGB}-D cameras, using pin-hole and fisheye lens models. The first main novelty is a feature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial {SLAM} system that fully relies on Maximum-a-Posteriori ({MAP}) estimation, even during the {IMU} initialization phase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that relies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial {SLAM} achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the {EuRoC} drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of {TUM}-{VI} dataset, a setting representative of {AR}/{VR} scenarios.

With such a range of vector formalisms in use, it thus appears that there is as yet no general agreement on a vector formalism suitable for science as a whole. This is surprising, in that, one of the primary goals of nineteenth century science was to suitably describe vectors in three-dimensional space. This situation has also had the unfortunate consequence of fragmenting knowledge across many disciplines, and requiring a signiﬁcant amount of time and effort in learning the various formalisms. We thus historically review the development of our various vector systems and conclude that Clifford’s multivectors best fulﬁlls the goal of describing vectorial quantities in three dimensions and providing a uniﬁed vector system for science.},

Key components of each Bayes filter are probabilistic prediction and observation models. This paper shows how non-parametric Gaussian process ({GP}) regression can be used for learning such models from training data. We also show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into different versions of Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended and unscented Kalman filters. The resulting {GP}-{BayesFilters} can have several advantages over standard (parametric) filters. Most importantly, {GP}-{BayesFilters} do not require an accurate, parametric model of the system. Given enough training data, they enable improved tracking accuracy compared to parametric models, and they degrade gracefully with increased model uncertainty. These advantages stem from the fact that {GPs} consider both the noise in the system and the uncertainty in the model. If an approximate parametric model is available, it can be incorporated into the {GP}, resulting in further performance improvements. In experiments, we show different properties of {GP}-{BayesFilters} using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp as well as synthetic data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) problem in the stochastic map framework based on the concept of the relative map. The idea consists in introducing a map state, which only contains relative quantities among the features invariant under shift and rotation. The estimation of this relative state is carried out through an Extended Kalman Filter. The shift and rotation invariance of the state allows us to significantly reduce the computational burden. In particular, the computational requirement is independent of the number of features. Furthermore, since the estimation process is local, it is not affected by the linearization introduced by the {EKF}. The cases of point features and corner features are considered. Furthermore, in the case of corners, it is considered a realistic case of an indoor environment containing structures consisting of several corners. Finally, since a relative map contains dependent elements, the information coming from all the constraints which express the elements dependency, is exploited. For this, an approximated solution with low computational requirement is proposed. Its limitation arises at the loop closure since it cannot exploit the information in this case. This is discussed in depth for the case of point features. Experimental results carried out on a real platform in our laboratory and by using the Victoria park dataset show the performance of the approach.},

It is shown that {SLAM} with a range and bearing sensor in an environment populated with point features can be decoupled into solving a nonlinear static estimation problem for mapping and a low-dimensional dynamic estimation problem for localization. This is achieved by transforming the measurement vector into two parts: one containing information relating features in the map and another with information relating the map and robot. It is shown that the new formulation results in an exactly sparse information matrix for mapping when it is solved using an Extended Information Filter ({EIF}).Thus a significant saving in the computational effort can be achieved for large-scale problems by exploiting the special properties of sparse matrices. An important feature of D-{SLAM} is that the correlation among features in the map are still kept and it is demonstrated that the uncertainty of the feature estimates monotonically decreases. The algorithm is illustrated and evaluated through computer simulations and experiments.},

	abstract = {Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is “close” to the actual nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates, for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., σ = 30◦ on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors commonly used in mapping. For most range-ﬁnder-based scenarios, the multihypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local minima even for high levels of noise.},

	abstract = {Weighted total least squares ({WTLS}) has been widely used as a standard method to optimally adjust an errors-in-variables ({EIV}) model containing random errors both in the observation vector and in the coefﬁcient matrix. An earlier work provided a simple and ﬂexible formulation for {WTLS} based on the standard least-squares ({SLS}) theory. The formulation allows one to directly apply the available {SLS} theory to the {EIV} models. Among such applications, this contribution formulates the {WTLS} problem subject to weighted or hard linear(ized) equality constraints on unknown parameters. The constraints are to be properly incorporated into the system of equations in an {EIV} model of which a general structure for the (singular) covariance matrix {QA} of the coefﬁcient matrix is used. The formulation can easily take into consideration any number of weighted linear and nonlinear constraints. Hard constraints turn out to be a special case of the general formulation of the weighted constraints. Because the formulation is based on the {SLS} theory, the method automatically approximates the covariance matrix of the estimates from which the precision of the constrained estimates can be obtained. Three numerical examples with different scenarios are used to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithm for geodetic applications. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){SU}.1943-5428.0000239. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, global positioning system ({GPS}) has been used widely in land vehicles to provide positioning services. However, information from this stand-alone device may be interrupted under some circumstances such as: urban environment, under the tunnels, etc. In addition, low-rate sample time typically 1Hz is another drawback of {GPS}. Therefore, {GPS} receiver can be augmented with the inertial navigation system ({INS}) to provide faster positioning information. By fusing {GPS} and {INS} data, the errors are bounded and accuracy increases considerably even when using low-cost {INS} and {GPS}. This paper presents a method of {INS}/{GPS} integration where a loosely coupled model is formulated and an extended Kalman filter is then applied to estimate information about position, velocity, and acceleration. Experiment results show that the processing time is reduced significantly but the estimated errors are acceptable (less than 1 meters) when applying the proposed integration method under the good signal of {GPS}. The performance evaluation is also implemented on several road trajectories in urban city that the 3 meters precision could be reached. In addition, accurate positioning and navigation results are still available from 9 to 14 seconds of {GPS} outages with the position errors spread from 3 to 10 meters ({RMS}).},

	title = {A Neural Network and Kalman Filter Hybrid Approach for {GPS}/{INS} Integration},
	abstract = {It is well known that Kalman filtering is an optimal real-time data fusion method for {GPS}/{INS} integration. However, it has some limitations in terms of stability, adaptability and observability. A Kalman filter can perform optimally only when its dynamic model is correctly defined and the noise statistics for the measurement and process are completely known. It is found that estimated Kalman filter states could be influenced by several factors, including vehicle dynamic variations, filter tuning results, and environment changes, etc., which are difficult to model. Neural networks can map input-output relationships without apriori knowledge about them; hence a proper designed neural network is capable of learning and extracting these complex relationships with enough training. This paper presents a {GPS}/{INS} integrated system that combines Kalman filtering and neural network algorithms to improve navigation solutions during {GPS} outages. An Extended Kalman filter estimates {INS} measurement errors, plus position, velocity and attitude errors etc. Kalman filter states, and gives precise navigation solutions while {GPS} signals are available. At the same time, a multi-layer neural network is trained to map the vehicle dynamics with corresponding Kalman filter states, at the same rate of measurement update. After the output of the neural network meets a similarity threshold, it can be used to correct {INS} measurements when no {GPS} measurements are available. Selecting suitable inputs and outputs of the neural network is critical for this hybrid method. Detailed analysis unveils that some Kalman filter states are highly correlated with vehicle dynamic variations. The filter states that heavily impact system navigation solutions are selected as the neural network outputs. The principle of this hybrid method and the neural network design are presented. Field test data are processed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The application of Global Navigation Satellite System ({GNSS}) technology has meant that marine navigators have greater access to a more consistent and accurate positioning capability than ever before. However, {GNSS} may not be able to meet all emerging navigation performance requirements for maritime applications with respect to service robustness, accuracy, integrity and availability. In particular, applications in port areas (for example automated docking) and in constricted waterways, have very stringent performance requirements. Even when an integrated inertial navigation system ({INS})/{GNSS} device is used there may still be performance gaps. {GNSS} signals are easily blocked or interfered with, and sometimes the satellite geometry may not be good enough for high accuracy and high reliability applications. Furthermore, the {INS} accuracy degrades rapidly during {GNSS} outages. This paper investigates the use of a portable ground-based positioning system, known as ‘Locata’, which was integrated with an {INS}, to provide accurate navigation in a marine environment without reliance on {GNSS} signals. An ‘on-the-fly’ Locata resolution algorithm that takes advantage of geometry change via an extended Kalman filter is proposed in this paper. Single-differenced Locata carrier phase measurements are utilized to achieve accurate and reliable solutions. A ‘loosely coupled’ decentralized Locata/{INS} integration architecture based on the Kalman filter is used for data processing. In order to evaluate the system performance, a field trial was conducted on Sydney Harbour. A Locata network consisting of eight Locata transmitters was set up near the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The experiment demonstrated that the Locata on-the-fly ({OTF}) algorithm is effective and can improve the system accuracy in comparison with the conventional ‘known point initialization’ ({KPI}) method. After the {OTF} and {KPI} comparison, the {OTF} Locata/{INS} integration is then assessed further and its performance improvement on both stand-alone {OTF} Locata and {INS} is shown. The Locata/{INS} integration can achieve centimetre-level accuracy for position solutions, and centimetre-per-second accuracy for velocity determination.},

	abstract = {A data gap of {GNSS} and {INS} may occur when data are collected by a vehicle. To obtain the pose information when this data gap appears, we use a combined auto regressive ({AR}) model for the forecasting of {INS} data so that the Strap-down Inertial Navigation System can still work. A forward process is initially implemented to forecast {INS} data using an {AR} model, and then inverse prediction is performed. Finally, the raw {INS} data are determined using forward and inverse results with different weights. The measurement data are applied to this method and the commercial software Inertial Explorer 8.60 ({IE}). The experimental result shows that the errors from the filtered results of the {IE} for loosely coupled and tightly coupled approaches reach the meter level after the data of the {GNSS} and {INS} are retrieved, and the error is at the meter level for conventional loosely coupled approach. Conversely, the maximum error from the proposed method is at the decimeter level. The smoother results have also been affected for the loosely coupled and tightly coupled approach of the {IE} before this data gap of {GNSS} and {INS} appears. However, a centimeter-level result can still be obtained via piecewise smoothing for the proposed method. The data gaps of 5 s and 10 s for {GNSS} and {INS} are simulated. These experiments show that the maximum errors of the smoother results are 0.4374 m and 4.0443 m for the proposed algorithm and these errors are better than the results for the loosely coupled and tightly coupled approach of the {IE} and the conventional loosely coupled approach.},

Moreover, the performance of the {FGO}-based {GNSS}/{INS} integration rely heavily on the size of the window of optimization. Effectively tuning the window size is still an open question. To fill this gap, this paper evaluates both loosely and tightly-coupled integrations using both {EKF} and {FGO} via the challenging dataset collected in the urban canyon. The detailed analysis of the results for the advantages of the {FGO} is also given in this paper by degenerating the {FGO}-based estimator to an {EKF} like estimator.

The integration of {GPS} with {INS} can be implemented using a Kalman filter in such modes as loosely, tightly and ultra-tightlycoupled. In all these integration modes the {INS} error states, together with any navigation state (position, velocity, attitude) and other unknown parameters of interest, are estimated using {GPS} measurements. In a high performance system it is expected that all these unknown states will be precisely estimated. Although it has been noted that both the quality of the {GPS} measurements and the trajectory and/or manoeuvre characteristics of the problem will have impacts on system performance, a systematic sensitivity analysis is still lacking. This paper will address this issue through real data analyses. The performance analysis results are very relevant to system design and platform trajectory and/or manoeuvre optimisation.},

	abstract = {Many applications demand high-precision navigation in urban environments. Two frequency real-time kinematic ({RTK}) Global Positioning System ({GPS}) receivers are too expensive for low-cost or consumer-grade projects. As single-frequency {GPS} receivers are getting less expensive and more capable, more people are utilizing single-frequency {RTK} {GPS} techniques to achieve high accuracy in such applications. However, compared with dual-frequency receivers, it is much more difficult to resolve the integer ambiguity vector using single-frequency phase measurements and therefore more difficult to achieve reliable high-precision navigation. This paper presents a real-time sliding-window estimator that tightly integrates differential {GPS} and an inertial measurement unit to achieve reliable high-precision navigation performance in {GPS}-challenged urban environments using low-cost single-frequency {GPS} receivers. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel method to utilize the phase measurements, without resolving the integer ambiguity vector. Experimental results demonstrate real-time position estimation performance at the decimeter level. Furthermore, the novel use of phase measurements improves the robustness of the estimator to pseudorange multipath error.},

Optimal information fusion corresponds to calculating the maximum a posteriori estimate over the joint probability distribution function (pdf) of all states, a computationally-expensive process in the general case. Our approach consists of two key components, which yields a flexible, high-rate, near-optimal inertial navigation system. First, the joint pdf is represented using a graphical model, the factor graph, that fully exploits the system sparsity and provides a plug and play capability that easily accommodates the addition and removal of measurement sources. Second, an efficient incremental inference algorithm over the factor graph is applied, whose performance approaches the solution that would be obtained by a computationally-expensive batch optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. To further aid highrate performance, we introduce an equivalent {IMU} factor based on a recently developed technique for {IMU} pre-integration, drastically reducing the number of states that must be added to the system. The proposed approach is experimentally validated using real {IMU} and imagery data that was recorded by a ground vehicle, and a statistical performance study is conducted in a simulated aerial scenario. A comparison to conventional fixed-lag smoothing demonstrates that our method provides a considerably improved trade-off between computational complexity and performance.},

Our algorithm has the merit of seamlessly handling nonlinearity of attitude, and is far simpler to implement than the extended Kalman ﬁlter ({EKF}), which is widely used in the navigation industry. The unscented transform notably spares the user the computation of Jacobians and lends itself well to fast prototyping in the context of multi-sensor data fusion. Besides, we provide the community with feedback about implementation, and execution time is shown to be compatible with real-time. Realistic extensive Monte-Carlo simulations prove uncertainty is estimated with accuracy by the ﬁlter, and illustrate its convergence ability.

This framework, {pyMDO}, was developed in Python and is shown to be an excellent platform for comparing the performance of the various {MDO} methods. {pyMDO} eliminates the need for reformulation when solving a given problem using different {MDO} methods: once a problem has been described, it can automatically be cast into any method. In addition, the modular design of {pyMDO} allows rapid development and benchmarking of new methods. Results generated from this study provide a strong foundation for identifying the performance trends of various methods with several types of problems.},

	abstract = {The {SLAM} problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a {SLAM} framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of {SLAM}. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for featurebased {SLAM}. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.},

	abstract = {5G millimeter wave ({mmWave}) signals can enable accurate positioning in vehicular networks when the base station and vehicles are equipped with large antenna arrays. However, radio-based positioning suffers from multipath signals generated by different types of objects in the physical environment. Multipath can be turned into a benefit, by building up a radio map (comprising the number of objects, object type, and object state) and using this map to exploit all available signal paths for positioning. We propose a new method for cooperative vehicle positioning and mapping of the radio environment, comprising a multiple-model probability hypothesis density filter and a map fusion routine, which is able to consider different types of objects and different fields of views. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {A uniquely pedagogical, insightful, and rigorous treatment of the analytical/geometrical foundations of optimization. Among its special features, the book: 1) Develops rigorously and comprehensively the theory of convex sets and functions, in the classical tradition of Fenchel and Rockafellar 2) Provides a geometric, highly visual treatment of convex and nonconvex optimization problems, including existence of solutions, optimality conditions, Lagrange multipliers, and duality 3) Includes an insightful and comprehensive presentation of minimax theory and zero sum games, and its connection with duality 4) Describes dual optimization, the associated computational methods, including the novel incremental subgradient methods, and applications in linear, quadratic, and integer programming 5) Contains many examples, illustrations, and exercises with complete solutions (about 200 pages) posted on the internet.{\textbackslash}{nFrom} the preface:{\textbackslash}{nThis} book focuses on the theory of convex sets and functions, and its connections with a number of topics that span a broad range from continuous to discrete optimization. These topics include Lagrange multiplier theory, Lagrangian and conjugate/Fenchel duality, minimax theory, and nondifferentiable optimization.{\textbackslash}{nThe} book evolved from a set of lecture notes for a graduate course at M.I.T. It is widely recognized that, aside from being an eminently useful subject in engineering, operations research, and economics, convexity is an excellent vehicle for assimilating some of the basic concepts of real analysis within an intuitive geometrical setting. Unfortunately, the subject's coverage in academic curricula is scant and incidental. We believe that at least part of the reason is the shortage of textbooks that are suitable for classroom instruction, particularly for nonmathematics majors. We have therefore tried to make convex analysis accessible to a broader audience by emphasizing its geometrical character, while maintaining mathematical rigor. We have included as many insightful illustrations as possible, and we have used geometric visualization as a principal tool for maintaining the students' interest in mathematical proofs.{\textbackslash}{nOur} treatment of convexity theory is quite comprehensive, with all major aspects of the subject receiving substantial treatment. The mathematical prerequisites are a course in linear algebra and a course in real analysis in finite dimensional spaces (which is the exclusive setting of the book). A summary of this material, without proofs, is provided in Section 1.1. The coverage of the theory has been significantly extended in the exercises, which represent a major component of the book. Detailed solutions of all the exercises (nearly 200 pages) are internet-posted in the book's www page{\textbackslash}{nSome} of the exercises may be attempted by the reader without looking at the solutions, while others are challenging but may be solved by the advanced reader with the assistance of hints. Still other exercises represent substantial theoretical results, and in some cases include new and unpublished research. Readers and instructors should decide for themselves how to make best use of the internet-posted solutions.{\textbackslash}{nAn} important part of our approach has been to maintain a close link between the theoretical treatment of convexity and its application to optimization.; Issue: 0; Includes bibliographical references (p. 517-527) and index},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first certifiably correct algorithm for distributed pose-graph optimization ({PGO}), the backbone of modern collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping ({CSLAM}) and camera network localization ({CNL}) systems. Our method is based upon a sparse semidefinite relaxation that we prove provides globally-optimal {PGO} solutions under moderate measurement noise (matching the guarantees enjoyed by state-of-the-art centralized methods), but is amenable to distributed optimization using the low-rank Riemannian Staircase framework. To implement the Riemannian Staircase in the distributed setting, we develop Riemannian block coordinate descent ({RBCD}), a novel method for (locally) minimizing a function over a product of Riemannian manifolds. We also propose the first distributed solution verification and saddle escape methods to certify the global optimality of critical points recovered via {RBCD}, and to descend from suboptimal critical points (if necessary). All components of our approach are inherently decentralized: they require only local communication, provide privacy protection, and are easily parallelizable. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method correctly recovers globally optimal solutions under moderate noise, and outperforms alternative distributed techniques in terms of solution precision and convergence speed.},

One of its features is that it results in an accurate determination of rotation, although a lack of predominant surfaces in certain directions may result in translational uncertainty in those directions. Hence, a loop-closing and relaxation problem is formulated that gains significant speed by relaxing only the translational errors and utilizes the full-translation covariance determined during pairwise registration. This leads to a fast 3D simultaneous localization and mapping suited for online operations. The approach is tested in two disaster scenarios that were mapped at the {NIST} 2008 Response Robot Evaluation Exercise in Disaster City, Texas. The two data sets from a collapsed car park and a flooding disaster consist of 26 and 70 3D scans, respectively. The results of these experiments show that our approach can generate 3D maps without motion estimates by odometry and that it outperforms iterative closest point–based mapping with respect to speed and robustness. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this note, a new Rauch-Tung-Striebel type form of the fixed-interval unscented Kalman smoother is derived. The new smoother differs from the previously proposed two-filter-formulation-based unscented Kalman smoother in the sense that it is not based on running two independent filters forward and backward in time. Instead, a separate backward smoothing pass is used, which recursively computes corrections to the forward filtering result. The smoother equations are derived as approximations to the formal Bayesian optimal smoothing equations. The performance of the new smoother is demonstrated with a simulation.},

The notion proposes a signal or image, unknown but supposed to be compressible by a known transform, (e.g. wavelet or Fourier), can be subjected to fewer measurements than the nominal number of data points, and yet be accurately reconstructed. The samples are nonadaptive and measure ‘random’ linear combinations of the transform coefficients. Approximate reconstruction is obtained by solving for the transform coefficients consistent with measured data and having the smallest possible ℓ1 norm. We present initial ‘proof-of-concept’ examples in the favorable case where the vast majority of the transform coefficients are zero. We continue with a series of numerical experiments, for the setting of ℓp-sparsity, in which the object has all coefficients nonzero, but the coefficients obey an ℓp bound, for some p∈(0,1]. The reconstruction errors obey the inequalities paralleling the theory, seemingly with well-behaved constants. We report that several workable families of ‘random’ linear combinations all behave equivalently, including random spherical, random signs, partial Fourier and partial Hadamard. We next consider how these ideas can be used to model problems in spectroscopy and image processing, and in synthetic examples see that the reconstructions from {CS} are often visually “noisy”. To suppress this noise we post-process using translation-invariant denoising, and find the visual appearance considerably improved. We also consider a multiscale deployment of compressed sensing, in which various scales are segregated and {CS} applied separately to each; this gives much better quality reconstructions than a literal deployment of the {CS} methodology. These results show that, when appropriately deployed in a favorable setting, the {CS} framework is able to save significantly over traditional sampling, and there are many useful extensions of the basic idea.},

A novel gridless direction finding method is proposed via the low-rank covariance matrix approximation, which is based on a reweighted nuclear norm optimization. In the proposed method, we first eliminate the noise variance variable by linear transform and utilize the covariance fitting criteria to determine the regularization parameter for insuring robustness. And then we reconstruct the low-rank covariance matrix by iteratively reweighted nuclear norm optimization that imposes the nonconvex penalty. Finally, we exploit the search-free {DoA} estimation method to perform the parameter estimation. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, results indicate that the proposed method has more accurate {DoA} estimation in the nonuniform noise and off-grid cases compared with the state-of-the-art {DoA} estimation algorithm.},

For these methods to work reliably, estimated matrices must not only be invertible but also well-conditioned. The current paper introduces a novel prior to ensure a well-conditioned maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) covariance estimate. The prior shrinks the sample covariance estimator towards a stable target and leads to a {MAP} estimator that is consistent and asymptotically efficient. Thus, the {MAP} estimator gracefully transitions towards the sample covariance matrix as the number of samples grows relative to the number of covariates. The utility of the {MAP} estimator is demonstrated in two standard applications–discriminant analysis and {EM} clustering–in challenging sampling regimes.},

	abstract = {Finding an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization of a covariance matrix is still an open problem in statistics. Its solution is of central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent high-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness constraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the progress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary perspectives: (1) generalized linear models ({GLM}) or parsimony and use of covariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for high-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both perspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of estimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of the regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a precision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical {LASSO} algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based Cholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and variance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and guarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It reduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a sequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the variables. Elementwise regularization of the sample covariance matrix such as banding, tapering and thresholding has desirable asymptotic properties and the sparse estimated covariance matrix is positive definite with probability tending to one for large samples and dimensions.},

These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms.

This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition – the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. We then survey visual place recognition solutions for environments where appearance change is assumed to be negligible. Long term robot operations have revealed that environments continually change; consequently we survey place recognition solutions that implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally we close with a discussion of the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid advances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding and video description.},

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative "turbo" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) algorithms.},

It does so by exploiting our {SLAM} navigation prior within the image registration pipeline and by being selective about which imagery is considered informative in terms of our visual {SLAM} map. A novel online bag-of-words measure for intraand inter-image saliency are introduced, and are shown to be useful for image key-frame selection, information-gain based link hypothesis, and novelty detection.

	abstract = {This paper reports on the problem of map-based visual localization in urban environments for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have become a reality on roadways and are going to be a consumer product in the near future. One of the most significant road-blocks to autonomous vehicles is the prohibitive cost of the sensor suites necessary for localization. The most common sensor on these platforms, a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging ({LIDAR}) scanner, generates dense point clouds with measures of surface reflectivity-which other state-of-the-art localization methods have shown are capable of centimeter-level accuracy. Alternatively, we seek to obtain comparable localization accuracy with significantly cheaper, commodity cameras. We propose to localize a single monocular camera within a 3D prior ground-map, generated by a survey vehicle equipped with 3D {LIDAR} scanners. To do so, we exploit a graphics processing unit to generate several synthetic views of our belief environment. We then seek to maximize the normalized mutual information between our real camera measurements and these synthetic views. Results are shown for two different datasets, a 3.0 km and a 1.5 km trajectory, where we also compare against the state-of-the-art in {LIDAR} map-based localization.},

This demonstrates that hidden structure exists in the {SLAM} problem that is yet to be understood. In this paper, we ﬁrst analyze how far {SLAM} is from a convex optimization problem. Then we show that by properly choosing the state vector, {SLAM} problem can be formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem with many quadratic terms in the objective function, thus it is clearer how far {SLAM} is from a linear least squares problem. Furthermore, we explain that how the map joining approaches reduce the nonlinearity/nonconvexity of the {SLAM} problem.},

Necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of two minima is derived and it is shown that more than one minimum exists only when the quality of the local maps used for map joining is extremely poor. The analysis explains to some extent why a number of optimization based {SLAM} algorithms proposed in the recent literature that rely on local search strategies are successful in converging to the globally optimal solution from poor initial conditions, particularly when covariance matrices are spherical. It also demonstrates that the map joining problem has special properties that may be exploited to reliably obtain globally optimal solutions to the {SLAM} problem.},

	abstract = {Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is “close” to the actual nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates, for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., σ = 30◦ on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors commonly used in mapping. For most range-ﬁnder-based scenarios, the multihypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local minima even for high levels of noise.},

We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and {DTAM} achieves real-time performance using current commodity {GPU} hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

	abstract = {Direct methods for visual odometry ({VO}) have gained popularity for their capability to exploit information from all intensity gradients in the image. However, low computational speed as well as missing guarantees for optimality and consistency are limiting factors of direct methods, in which established feature-based methods succeed instead. Based on these considerations, we propose a semidirect {VO} ({SVO}) that uses direct methods to track and triangulate pixels that are characterized by high image gradients, but relies on proven feature-based methods for joint optimization of structure and motion. Together with a robust probabilistic depth estimation algorithm, this enables us to efficiently track pixels lying on weak corners and edges in environments with little or high-frequency texture. We further demonstrate that the algorithm can easily be extended to multiple cameras, to track edges, to include motion priors, and to enable the use of very large field of view cameras, such as fisheye and catadioptric ones. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the algorithm is significantly faster than the state of the art while achieving highly competitive accuracy.},

In this work we propose an approach to identify symmetries and exploit them in Structure from Motion ({SfM}). Our ﬁrst contribution is a symmetry detection approach that uses the 3D geometry of the scene as well as 2D appearance clues. We show that a particular parametrization of the transformation space (space in which each point represents a candidate symmetry relation) exposes the dominant symmetries in the scene. Then, we use appearance information to prune incorrect symmetry hypotheses. The second contribution is a constrained bundle adjustment ({CBA}) scheme that jointly optimizes for the best 3D reconstruction and the symmetry generators. Contrarily to related work on {CBA}, our approach models n-fold (rotational and translational) repetitions of architectural elements, and allows estimating a generative model of the 3D geometry. Experimental results conﬁrm that our method can correctly identify and exploit partial symmetries in noisy and sparse {SfM} datasets.},

	shorttitle = {Steps Towards a Theory of Visual Information},
	abstract = {This manuscript describes the elements of a theory of information tailored to control and decision tasks and specifically to visual data. The concept of Actionable Information is described, that relates to a notion of information championed by J. Gibson, and a notion of "complete information" that relates to the minimal sufficient statistics of a complete representation. It is shown that the "actionable information gap" between the two can be reduced by exercising control on the sensing process. Thus, senging, control and information are inextricably tied. This has consequences in the so-called "signal-to-symbol barrier" problem, as well as in the analysis and design of active sensing systems. It has ramifications in vision-based control, navigation, 3-D reconstruction and rendering, as well as detection, localization, recognition and categorization of objects and scenes in live video. This manuscript has been developed from a set of lecture notes for a summer course at the First International Computer Vision Summer School ({ICVSS}) in Scicli, Italy, in July of 2008. They were later expanded and amended for subsequent lectures in the same School in July 2009. Starting on November 1, 2009, they were further expanded for a special topics course, {CS}269, taught at {UCLA} in the Spring term of 2010.},

However, previous work did not provide a principled way to choose the continuous-time motion prior or its parameters on a real robotic system. This letter derives a novel data-driven motion prior where ground truth trajectories of a moving robot are used to train a motion prior that better represents the robot's motion. In this approach, we use a prior where latent accelerations are represented as a {GP} with a Matérn covariance function and draw a connection to the Singer acceleration model. We then formulate a variation of {STEAM} using this new prior. We train the {WNOA}, {WNOJ}, and our new latent-force prior and evaluate their performance in the context of both lidar localization and lidar odometry of a car driving along a 20 km route, where we show improved state estimates compared to the two previous formulations.},

In this letter, we learn the covariances for the motion and sensor models used within vehicle trajectory estimation. Speciﬁcally, we learn the parameters of a white-noise-on-acceleration motion model and the parameters of an Inverse-Wishart prior over measurement covariances for our sensor model. We demonstrate our technique using a 36 km dataset consisting of a car using lidar to localize against a high-deﬁnition map; we learn the parameters on a training section of the data and then show that we achieve high-quality state estimates on a test section, even in the presence of outliers.

	abstract = {It is well known that inertial navigation systems can provide high-accuracy position, velocity, and attitude information over short time periods. However, their accuracy rapidly degrades with time. The requirements for an accurate estimation of navigation information necessitate the modeling of the sensors’ error components. Several variance techniques have been devised for stochastic modeling of the error of inertial sensors. They are basically very similar and primarily differ in that various signal processings, by way of weighting functions, window functions, etc., are incorporated into the analysis algorithms in order to achieve a particular desired result for improving the model characterizations. The simplest is the Allan variance. The Allan variance is a method of representing the root means square ({RMS}) randomdrift error as a function of averaging time. It is simple to compute and relatively simple to interpret and understand. The Allan variance method can be used to determine the characteristics of the underlying random processes that give rise to the data noise. This technique can be used to characterize various types of error terms in the inertial-sensor data by performing certain operations on the entire length of data. In this paper, the Allan variance technique will be used in analyzing and modeling the error of the inertial sensors used in different grades of the inertial measurement units. By performing a simple operation on the entire length of data, a characteristic curve is obtained whose inspection provides a systematic characterization of various random errors contained in the inertial-sensor output data. Being a directly measurable quantity, the Allan variance can provide information on the types and magnitude of the various error terms. This paper covers both the theoretical basis for the Allan variance for modeling the inertial sensors’ error terms and its implementation in modeling different grades of inertial sensors.},

Current methods for Allan variance analysis have been rooted in the human-based interpretation of linear trends, referred to as the slope method. The slope method is so prolific; it is referenced among electrical and electronics engineering standards for {IMU} error analysis. However, the graphical nature and visual-inspection–based use of the method limit its ability to be programmed as a generalized algorithm, which hinders the autonomy desired in modern-day navigation computations. Using nonlinear regression with a ridge-regression initial guess, the proposed method is shown to produce comparable results to the gold standard slope method when using standard-length data collections and outperforms the slope method when the amount of available data is limited. This development directly enables accurate navigation solutions for all vehicles in land, air, sea, and space operations.},

We present a dynamic programming algorithm for eﬃcient recovery of the marginal covariances needed for data association. As input we use a square root information matrix as maintained by our incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) algorithm. The contributions beyond our previous work are an improved algorithm for recovering the marginal covariances and a more thorough treatment of data association now including the joint compatibility branch and bound ({JCBB}) algorithm. We further show how to make information theoretic decisions about measurements before actually taking the measurement, therefore allowing a reduction in estimation complexity by omitting uninformative measurements.

We implement a sentiment analysis model using a recurrent convolutional neural network to predict the stock trend from the financial news. The objective of this paper is not to build a better trading bot, but to prove that reinforcement learning is capable of learning the tricks of stock trading.},

In this work, we propose an iterative expectation–maximization ({EM}) algorithm to estimate the model-error covariances using classical extended and ensemble versions of the Kalman smoother. We show that, for additive model errors, the estimate of the error covariance converges. We also investigate other forms of model error, such as parametric or multiplicative errors. We show that additive Gaussian model error is able to compensate for non-additive sources of error in the algorithms we propose. We also demonstrate the limitations of the extended version of the algorithm and recommend the use of the more robust and flexible ensemble version. This article is a proof of concept of the methodology with the Lorenz-63 attractor. We developed an open-source Python library to enable future users to apply the algorithm to their own nonlinear dynamical models.},

	abstract = {We address covariance estimation in the sense of minimum mean-squared error ({MMSE}) when the samples are Gaussian distributed. Speciﬁcally, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf ({LW}) method by conditioning on a sufﬁcient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called {RBLW}, whose mean-squared error dominates that of {LW} for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage ({OAS}) estimator. Both {RBLW} and {OAS} estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to speciﬁed constants. The {RBLW} estimator provably dominates the {LW} method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the {OAS} approach can perform even better than {RBLW}, especially when n is much less than p. We also demonstrate the performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.},
